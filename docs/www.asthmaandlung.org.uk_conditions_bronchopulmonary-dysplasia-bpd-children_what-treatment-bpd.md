On this page we explain the different types of treatment your baby with BPD might have, and the things you can do to help your child at home.

## How is BPD treated?
If your child has mild bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), they may not need any special treatment except additional oxygen. Others may need help to support their breathing if:
* they develop another lung condition, such as [bronchiolitis](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/bronchiolitis) or [pneumonia](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/pneumonia-in-children)
* their lungs don’t develop fully after they are born.
### Breathing support
Your baby may have had support with their breathing in hospital with a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) or ventilator machine. 
CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) is a type of breathing machine that helps your baby to breathe by moving air into their lungs and keeping the air sacs open. A ventilator is also a machine that helps you to breathe. 
Your baby may have needed this treatment very early on if they had respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Some babies with moderate to severe BPD continue to need it and may go home with breathing support. 
### Oxygen
If your child has low blood oxygen levels, they may need [home oxygen therapy.](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/oxygen) This is given to them through a tube in their nose. Bliss also has more information on [additional oxygen](https://www.bliss.org.uk/parents/going-home/preparing-to-go-home/going-home-on-oxygen?p=going-home-on-oxygen) at home for babies. Most babies with BPD only need additional oxygen until they are about a year old. 
### Anti-inflammatory medicines
These medicines can help stop the lungs becoming inflamed or treat existing inflammation. This makes BPD less severe. 
The most common type of anti-inflammatory medicine are steroids. These are most powerful when taken by mouth or by injection, but they can cause side effects, particularly in young babies. Using an inhaler or [nebuliser](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/nebulisers) to take steroids means they go directly into your child’s lungs. This can reduce side effects, but researchers aren’t sure how effective they are in BPD. 
## Other treatments your child may have
### Water medicines called diuretics
Babies with BPD may have fluid in the lungs. Diuretics can help move excess water out of the lungs by making your child wee more. These medicines may be used when the babies are on the neonatal unit. There is no current evidence to support the use of diuretics in established BPD. 
### Reliever medications called bronchodilators
Your child may be given an inhaler to help relax the muscles of their airways when they are wheezing or having difficulty breathing. This is not a treatment for BPD, but a treatment for symptoms. 
## What else can I do to help my child with BPD?
There are lots of things that parents can do to help children with BPD. 
* **Do not smoke or vape, or let others smoke, around your child.** For support, take a look at our information on [how to stop smoking.](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/smoking)
* **Try to avoid exposing your child to air pollution where possible.** Have a look at our information on [air pollution](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/air-pollution) and [indoor air pollution.](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/indoor-air-pollution)
* **Make sure your child’s vaccinations are up to date** and ask your doctor about the flu vaccine and [vaccination against RSV](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/bronchiolitis). Doctors may recommend the RSV vaccination for babies in their first winter, to help prevent serious infection.
* **Make sure they have a healthy diet.** Breathing, fighting infection, and coughing can use up your child’s energy. Their immune system will need plenty of protein and vitamins to fight infection. The NHS website has [useful information about feeding young babies.](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/understanding-food-groups.aspx)
* **Avoid infection where possible.** Teach your children to use disposable tissues and wash their hands after coughing and sneezing. Make sure that you do this, too. We’ve got more information about [what you can do to avoid infection.](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/when-your-child-is-diagnosed/making-your-home-lung-friendly)

## Will my child need to go to hospital?
Children with BPD are more likely to have problems in the first 2-3 years of their life. Your child is more likely to need to go to hospital during this time, especially if they get an infection or have trouble breathing. 
## Support for parents and carers
We know seeing your baby being treated in hospital can be difficult. It’s important you take time to take care of yourself, as well as them. Talk to your doctor or nurse if you feel like you’re struggling to cope. You can always call our helpline – our friendly team can help answer your questions or worries. Call **0300 222 5800**, Monday to Friday between **9am – 5pm** (excluding Bank Holidays).
Ask your child’s doctors who you can contact if you have any questions, or if you’re unsure about something. When your child is discharged from hospital, it’s important that you can recognise if your child is becoming ill, and when you should seek emergency care. Agree on a plan with the doctor or nurse about what you should do.
You may also want to join our [Parent and Carer Support Network](https://www.blf.org.uk/parent-and-carer-support-network) which provides support and a space for parents and carers of children with lung conditions to come together.
