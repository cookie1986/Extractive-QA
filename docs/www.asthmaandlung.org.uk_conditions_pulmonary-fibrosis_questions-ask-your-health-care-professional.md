# Questions to ask your health care professional
It can be difficult to know what to ask your GP, nurse or specialist when you have pulmonary fibrosis. 
We’ve put together some questions you might like to ask as you see different health care professionals at different times during your diagnosis and treatment.
## Diagnosis
It’s important to discover if your symptoms are caused by pulmonary fibrosis, so your GP or specialist will do some tests.
* What tests will I need and what will they involve?
* Why are these tests important?
* Where will these tests happen?
* When will I find out the results?
## After diagnosis
Find out more about pulmonary fibrosis, how it will affect you and what treatment and support is available.
* What is pulmonary fibrosis? Where can I get more information?
* Can you tell me more about how my pulmonary fibrosis is progressing?
* What support is available to me?
* What can I do to help my condition?
* Can I have the contact details for a specialist lung nurse? When should I contact them?
* How often will I need to come back for appointments?
> “Keep asking questions; if you don’t understand then ask again. I think it’s important that I understand what is happening and what it means for me.” *Ann*

## Managing my pulmonary fibrosis
Medication can’t cure pulmonary fibrosis, but it can help slow down its progression and help with your symptoms.
* What medication is available?
* Am I eligible for these drugs?
* What are the side effects?
* Where can I find additional information about these medications?
* How will I know if the treatment is working?
* What happens if I decide not to have this treatment?
* Are there any clinical trials I can take part in?
**Oxygen therapy** might help you feel less out of breath and tired if your blood oxygen levels are low.
* How can oxygen therapy help me?
* How will I be assessed to see if oxygen could help?
* What sorts of oxygen therapy are there?
* Will I be able to take my oxygen supply out and about or on holiday with me?
Whether a **lung transplant** is suitable for you depends on things like your age and general health.
* Is a lung transplant an option for me?
* What are the risks and benefits of having a lung transplant?
* What is the process for getting a lung transplant?
* How long would I have to wait?
**Pulmonary rehabilitation** classes provide physical activity and advice on looking after your lungs.
* What will the classes involve?
* How will they help me?
* Can you refer me for pulmonary rehabilitation classes?
* How should I keep exercising after the classes finish?
## Thinking about the future
It’s difficult to predict how pulmonary fibrosis will progress. Everyone is different so ask about your individual situation.
* What can be done to help me if I get more breathless?
* What services are offered to help with my symptoms?
* How can I and my carers access these care services?
* Is there anything I need to do to plan for the future?
