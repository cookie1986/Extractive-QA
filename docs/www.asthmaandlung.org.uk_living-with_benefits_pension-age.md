## State Pension
The new State Pension is a regular payment you can claim if you reach state pension age on or after 6 April 2016. You will not get the pension automatically, you need to claim it. You should get a letter no later than two months before you reach state pension age telling you what to do.
You can [apply for your state pension online](https://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension/how-to-claim). 
## Cost of living payments
In England, Scotland, and Wales the government is offering payments to help with the cost of living crisis. You could get:
* £300 for pensioner households, to be paid during winter 2023 to 2024
* an extra £150 if you are on an eligible disability benefit, to be paid during summer 2023
These payments will not affect the benefits or tax credits you get. The government has [the most up to date guidance about cost of living payments](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cost-of-living-payment#cost-of-living-payments-2023-to-2024). 
Find out more about [cost of living payments in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/cost-living-payments). 
## Attendance Allowance (AA)
Attendance Allowance (AA) is a benefit paid to people over the state pension age who have personal care needs.
You should apply for AA if you have a disability or illness and need help with your personal care. For example, you might need help with: 
* eating
* drinking
* washing
* getting dressed
* going to the toilet
* getting in and out of bed.
AA is paid at either a higher or lower rate, depending on your level of need. You must have had care needs for at least six months. There is no mobility payment with AA and any mobility difficulties outside the home are not taken into account.
The government has [more information about AA](https://www.gov.uk/attendance-allowance).
Citizens Advice can [help you with your AA application](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/sick-or-disabled-people-and-carers/attendance-allowance/claiming-attendance-allowance/help-with-attendance-allowance-form/). 
##  Pension Credit
If you’re over the state pension age and on a low income, you may be able to get Pension Credit to help with living costs.
Find out [more about Pension Credit in England, Scotland, and Wales](https://www.gov.uk/pension-credit).
Find out [more about Pension Credit in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/understanding-pension-credit).
## Winter Fuel payments
A Winter Fuel payment is a tax-free payment for people born on or before 25 September 1956 to help pay heating costs.
It is usually paid automatically every year between November and December. If you are eligible but have not received this automatically, you can [make a claim](https://www.gov.uk/winter-fuel-payment/how-to-claim).
Winter fuel payments do not depend on how cold the weather gets.
## Blue badge scheme
A blue badge helps you or your carer to park closer to where you’re going. If you get certain benefits, you’re automatically eligible.
You can also apply if you have long-term problems with walking or problems with walking that your doctor says will last at least a year. You’ll have to fill in an extra section of the form and may need an assessment by your local council.
