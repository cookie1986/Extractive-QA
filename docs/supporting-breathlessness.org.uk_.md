# Supporting Breathlessness
‘Supporting Someone with Breathlessness’ is a source full of help and advice made for family and friends of people with breathlessness (sometimes called “carers”).
To make sure it is as helpful to you as possible, it has been carefully made with a range of experts including health professionals, health researchers and people just like you, who have cared for someone with breathlessness.
 
*This short video below explains why we have made this website especially for carers of people with breathlessness. Please then explore our support topics below this video.*
# Support topics
Below are the main topics carers told us they want to know more about. Within each you can see, hear and read advice from experts, carers and patients.
Click on either “Cancer” or “COPD” depending on the illness the person you support is living with. This will take you to the right information for their illness.
