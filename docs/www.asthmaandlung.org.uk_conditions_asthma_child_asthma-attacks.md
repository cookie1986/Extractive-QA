## 
 Actions to take if your child has an asthma attack
1. Help them to sit up – don’t let them lie down. Try to keep them calm.
2. Help them take one puff of their reliever inhaler (with their spacer, if they have it) every 30 to 60 seconds, up to a total of 10 puffs.
3. If they don’t have their reliever inhaler, or it’s not helping, or if you are worried at any time, call 999 for an ambulance.
4. If the ambulance has not arrived after 10 minutes and their symptoms are not improving, repeat step 2.
5. If their symptoms are no better after repeating step 2, and the ambulance has still not arrived, contact 999 again immediately.
## When to call 999
Don’t delay getting the help you need if your child has an asthma attack. Call 999 if your child’s reliever isn’t helping, or you’re worried at any time.
While you wait for an ambulance, your child can repeat step 2 above, but if their symptoms are still no better, contact 999 again.
“An asthma attack is a real emergency, and could be life-threatening,” says nurse specialist Debby Waddell.
“Getting the right help when your child needs it is so important, to make sure your child is treated quickly. Never think you’re wasting anyone’s time.”
## When to call your doctor
If you managed your child’s asthma attack with their blue reliever inhaler, and their symptoms improved, you still need to make an urgent same-day appointment with their doctor.
It’s important for them to have an urgent asthma review after the attack. 
## Recognise the signs of an asthma attack
An asthma attack happens when your child’s asthma symptoms get much worse.
This can happen quite suddenly or can build up gradually over a few days.
### Your child might:
* find it hard to breathe
* breathe more quickly
* be unable to talk or walk or eat
* wheeze and cough a lot
* complain of a tight chest or a tummy ache
* say their [blue reliever inhaler](https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/inhalers-medicines-treatments/inhalers-and-spacers/reliever/) isn’t helping, or they need it more than every four hours  
be unusually quiet.
* If your child needs to use their blue reliever inhaler three or more times a week, it’s a sign that their asthma is not well controlled.
Make an appointment with your GP or asthma nurse to review their asthma as soon as possible.
