# Wing Walking
Take to the skies for an unforgettable wing walk, flying at speeds of up to 120mph for an extreme adrenaline rush!
Brace yourself as your pilot goes through the motions with a series of climbs, banks and dives whilst flying across the skies of Gloucestershire or Kent.
Bring along your friends and family to cheer and wave to you from one of the viewing areas!! Once you have landed you will receive your wing walk certificate and chance to watch back the on-board video recording of your flight. Â
