 Check your State Pension age
Your State Pension age is the earliest age you can start receiving your State Pension. It may be different to the age you can get a [workplace or personal pension](/early-retirement-pension/personal-and-workplace-pensions).
[The State Pension age is under review](/government/news/proposed-new-timetable-for-state-pension-age-increases) and may change in the future.
Use this tool to check:
* when you’ll reach State Pension age
* your Pension Credit qualifying age
* when you’ll be eligible for free bus travel
 [Start now](/state-pension-age/y)
## Before you start
You can [keep working after you reach State Pension age](/working-retirement-pension-age). ‘Default retirement age’ (a forced retirement age of 65) no longer exists.
[Check your State Pension forecast](/check-state-pension) to find out how much money you’ll get.
