## GP Patient Survey 2018: seeking your feedback on possible questionnaire changes
---
#### Why is the questionnaire changing?
There are many changes currently being made to GP services. These changes are set out in the 
 [GP Forward View](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gpfv.pdf), which outlines 
 NHS England’s vision for primary care. These changes include, but are not limited to, offering appointments in extended hours, 
 and providing new ways for people to access GP services. These changes will affect how patients and the 
 public experience their local services, and as such we need to ensure that the GP Patient Survey (GPPS) remains relevant in this context, 
 and continues to ask about the right things and in the right way. As a consequence, questions across the survey may be modified, 
 removed or replaced. While we intend to retain questions that are widely used and which remain relevant where possible, it should be 
 noted that wider changes to the questionnaire mean that we cannot be certain that data trends will be maintained.
 
As this is a good opportunity to take stock, as well as anticipating changes to the ‘GP Access’ questions (Q1-Q20), we also anticipate considering other improvements to the survey.
 This will include the sections of the questionnaire that deal with ‘Managing your health,’ ‘Your state of health today,’ and ‘Planning your care’ (Q30-Q39). This is so that we can 
 get a better understanding of how local care services are supporting patients to live well, particularly patients with long-term care needs. 
 

 However, the questionnaire as a whole is under review, so please take this into account when providing feedback. 
 

 In this context, GPPS data users are invited to give any comments they may have about proposed changes to the questionnaire.
