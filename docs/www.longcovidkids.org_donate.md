# Awareness
Raising awareness and early intervention can improve health and learning outcomes for children and young people.
​
 We aim to provide families and healthcare professionals and schools with appropriate educational materials.
 
We want to reduce stigma, support and educate.
​
We want to provide the facts clearly in multiple languages so families can make informed decisions about their health. 
###### Support
To continue to improve the support services we offer, we hope to engage;
Youth workers
  Play Therapists   
Occupational Therapists
Counsellors 
​
We run regional meet-ups in local communities to enable families to connect, and kids can meet each other in person.  We would like to offer training and resources.
###### Research
Long Covid Kids are keen to support coproduced paediatric biomedical research.
 
We understand how important it is that  of children and young people inform research. 
 
We hope to improve opportunities for our members, and our youth advisory panel and fund research on the long-term impact of Long Covid on children and young people and their families at home and in education.
###### Action
The Long Covid Kids team won't give up on our campaigning for improved indoor air quality. 
 
We would be thrilled to be able to support schools to achieve this to reduce future risk of transmission and disease.
