This guidance gives an overview of the conditions of use of a parking card for people with disabilities in each EU country.
You can use your UK Blue Badge when travelling in some European Union (EU) countries, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.
Parking concessions vary in each country. Further information is available on:
* [Parking card for people with disabilities in the European Union](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/transport-disability/parking-card-disabilities-people/index_en.htm)
* [FIA Guide for the disabled traveller: using parking permits, cards and placards in the EU and EEA](http://www.disabledmotorists.eu/en/world_map/europe/europe.htm)
* [The FIA Disabled Motoring](https://disabledmotoring.fia.com/region/europe) website
## Where your UK Blue Badge is recognised in Europe
The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is no longer part of the EU Disabled Parking Card scheme
You can still use your UK Blue Badge when travelling in some EU countries, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.
The UK has informally agreed to continue the mutual recognition of the EU disabled parking card for visitors to the UK. Some EU and EEA countries have committed to reciprocate this gesture, but these agreements are not mandatory.
Recognition of foreign issued parking cards remains at the discretion of the administering authority in the host country.
### Always check locally before parking
The UK Blue Badge remains compliant with the EU model for disabled parking cards and where recognised, should be displayed with an accompanying notice in the language of the country of travel
