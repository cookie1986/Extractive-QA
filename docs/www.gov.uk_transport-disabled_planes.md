 Planes
Tell your airline at least 48 hours before departure if you’ll need help.
Airlines and airports have different facilities for disabled people. Find out from your airport or airline if they have the facilities you need, for example a toilet with disabled access.
## Help at the airport
If you have a sensory, physical or learning disability which affects your mobility when using transport, at airports in the UK and EU you have the right to:
* help at specific arrival points, such as at terminal entrances, at transport interchanges and in car parks
* help to reach check-in
* help with registration at check-in
* help with moving through the airport if you need it, including to toilets
* help to board the plane
You’ll also have the right to help because of your age or a temporary illness or injury - for example if you’ve broken your leg and it’s in a cast.
You can travel with up to 2 items of mobility equipment free of charge if you’re disabled. This will not count as part of your baggage allowance.
## Help on the plane
If you have a sensory, physical or learning disability which affects your mobility on a flight, in the UK and EU you have the right to:
* get information about your flight in a way you understand it
* help to find a seat that is suited to your needs
* help to move around the plane, including to toilets
## Taking your wheelchair on the plane
You cannot take your own wheelchair into the passenger cabin of a plane - it will be stored in the hold. Speak to your airline to find out what help they’ll provide when boarding.
Tell your airline, travel agent or tour operator as soon as possible if you’re taking on a battery-powered wheelchair or mobility aid.
## Travelling with a companion
You must travel with a companion if you’re not self reliant, for example if you need help with feeding, breathing, using medication or using the toilet.
The airline you’re flying with will do their best to make sure you sit next to each other, so long as you tell them at least 48 hours before departure.
## Travelling with an assistance dog
You have the right to travel with your assistance dog. You’ll need to follow the [rules on pet travel](/take-pet-abroad/overview).
## Report a problem
If you’re unhappy with the help you get, complain to the airport or airline directly.
If you cannot resolve the problem with them, you can complain to either:
* an [alternative dispute resolution (ADR) body](https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/Resolving-travel-problems/How-the-CAA-can-help/Alternative-dispute-resolution/)
* the [Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)](https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/Resolving-travel-problems/How-the-CAA-can-help/How-the-CAA-can-help/) if the airline or airport does not have an agreement with an ADR
