# How the Motability Scheme works
Exchange your qualifying mobility allowance for a brand-new car, Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle (WAVWheelchair Accessible Vehicle), scooter or powered wheelchair, so you can enjoy more freedom and independence.

### 
Can I join the Scheme?
Yes, as long as you receive a [qualifying mobility allowance](/how-it-works/allowances/) with at least 12 months left. You can check right now – just answer a few questions.
[Check now](# "Check now")

### 
Which type of vehicle suits me best?
Different vehicles suit different people, so we’ll help you decide between our vehicle types and any adaptations. We’ll help you make sure you’re making the right choice for you.

### 
How do I pay?
We’ll receive your payments straight from your allowance provider, to make paying simple. So you know – you might need to top this up with an Advance Payment.

![Illustration of a woman with a walking stick looking lovingly at and taking a photo of a mobility scooter](/-/media/images/decorative/illustrations/scooter-1.svg)
### 
How do I apply and order?
You can start applying online if it’s a car or a WAVWheelchair Accessible Vehicle. Once you’ve had a test drive and you’ve found a vehicle you like, visit a Motability Scheme dealer and they’ll order it for you.

### 
How do I get my vehicle?
You’ll pick it up from your local dealer, if it’s a car. If it’s a different vehicle, they’ll deliver it to your home. Once you’re happy with it, you can start enjoying your vehicle.
