# Will you help older people in Turkey and Syria?
Major earthquakes have struck southern Turkey and northern Syria.
The death toll is rising by the hour and is expected to increase significantly. Buildings have been flattened and vital infrastructure such as roads, hospitals and schools damaged. The winter weather is worsening in the region, with heavy storms and snow hampering relief efforts and increasing the risks for survivors.
Survivors urgently need shelter, medical assistance and food. Please donate today.
# Older people are at risk
Older people are amongst those most at-risk right now:
* They may live alone or have become separated from their family and friends
* They may have mobility problems which make it difficult to reach safety and find shelter
* They may have health conditions which make them particularly vulnerable to the cold
# How your donation could help older people
Age International’s partners in Turkey and Syria are urgently assessing the situation to identify those most in need.
Your donation could help with aid and support that is tailored to the needs of older people and their families. The situation is rapidly evolving but this could include:
* Hot meals, heating, blankets, tents and warm clothing
* Tailored medical assistance and medicines
* Cash assistance so that older people can buy the things they need
**Please donate today, even a small donation could make a huge difference.**
*Age International is raising money together with the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) for the DEC Turkey-Syria Earthquake Appeal. The DEC is a consortium of 15 aid member charities working together in times of disasters and emergencies. For more information on the DEC and our fellow member agencies please visit* [*www.dec.org.uk*](http://www.dec.org.uk/)*. Any income not spent after twelve months past the end of the appeal may be allocated to another emergency situation that requires our support.*

Are you donating your own money?
* Yes, this donation is my own money
* No, this is money I've collected from others
 We can claim Gift Aid if this is your own money, it has not come from anyone else e.g. a business, friends, family, collection or proceeds from sale of goods and as long as it does not depend on receiving benefits in return e.g. entry to an event or raffle.

 If you're a UK tax payer, £50 would be worth £62.50 with Gift Aid
 
 Yes, I would like to Gift Aid my donations
 
 Yes, I want Age UK and its partner organisations (Age Cymru, Age Scotland and Age NI) to treat all donations I have made for the four years prior to this year, and all donations I make from the date of this declaration until I notify you otherwise, as Gift Aid donations. I am a UK tax payer and understand that if I pay less income tax and/or capital gains tax than the amount of Gift Aid claimed on all my donations in that tax year it is my responsibility to pay any difference.
 
 When you give money to Age UK under Gift Aid, we will reclaim basic rate tax on that money – currently 25 pence to the pound. If you are a UK tax payer, this means that **£1.00 would be worth £1.25 just so long as donations are made through Gift Aid**. Imagine what a difference that could make and at no extra cost to you. **We can only claim Gift Aid where your full name and home address is provided**.
