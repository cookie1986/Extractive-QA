Self-management of your COPD will help give you control of your condition. On this page, we explain why COPD self-management is important and provide links for you to download your own COPD self-management plan.
## What is a COPD self-management plan?
A COPD self-management plan is for people living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It’s designed to help you to manage and understand your condition, with guidance and support from your health care professionals when you need it. It should support you to find ways that suit you to manage your symptoms, help you to feel better, and to take control.

## Why is self-management important?
When you have a long-term condition, you might sometimes feel you don’t have control over your health, your life, and what happens to you.
Self-managing your condition – with support from others – helps to give you control. It's important to know all about your condition, your symptoms, your medication, and how to cope with flare-ups. It also makes your day-to-day life easier and could reduce the risk of needing to go into hospital.

## How to get the most out of your COPD self-management plan
Self-management works best when supported by others. Share your plan with your GP, respiratory nurse, or other health care professionals involved in your care. It may also help to discuss your plan with your family, carers, and friends, so they can support you too.
The first half of our self-management plan explains what COPD is, how you can manage it well, and what to do if you have a flare-up of your symptoms. The second half has blank forms for you to complete to help you monitor your condition and progress.
Use our self-management plan in the way that works best for you – daily, weekly, or monthly. It doesn’t need to be completed overnight!
