## Got questions? Here's what we're asked most
Select a question on the left to view its answer.
[**How does Give as you Live Online work?**](#answer1)
Give as you Live Online generates charitable giving from your everyday shopping. Our retail partners value your loyalty. We enable their "thank you" to be your donation to your chosen charity.
[**Who can I raise money for?**](#answer2)
You can support any of our 40,000+ UK charities.
Our charities range from big national charities to local schools, churches and social groups.
[**Where does the donation come from?**](#answer3)
As a "thank you" for sending them sales and customers, our stores pay us a commission. We use this commission to make a donation to your chosen charity.
You don't pay anything extra for your shopping, the donation is made at no extra cost to you.
It's also completely free for your charity. There are no joining or payment fees for them, so 100% of the donation will reach the charity.
[**When will my charity receive its donation?**](#answer4)
We pay donations raised through shopping to your charity every three months providing over £15 has been raised. If your charity hasn't reached £15, donations will roll over until they do and then get paid in the next quarter.
You can view the status of every donation within your account. A donation will typically move from 'pending' to 'approved' to 'paid' over the course of a few months.
[**How does Give as you Live Online operate?**](#answer5)
We donate 50% of the commission we receive, with the other 50% used to fund the on-going development of Give as you Live Online, which is free to all charities and members.
All donation amounts we display represent the amount the charity will receive - a 5% donation means a 5% donation!

##### About Asthma and Lung UK
 
![Asthma and Lung UK](/charity/111316/images/homepage/logo-md.jpg?20220419142818)
###### Asthma and Lung UK
**Charity number:** 326730
**Website:** [www.asthmaandlung.org.uk](https://www.asthmaandlung.org.uk/)
**Description:**
At Asthma + Lung UK, we believe that every breath matters - and that the right to breathe freely applies to everybody, regardless of income, age, ethnicity, gender, or background. 
Whoever said, “We all breathe the same air” didn’t grow up in any of the places in the UK where air pollution exceeds the World Health Organisation’s recommended limits. Didn’t have to worry about being one of the 36,000 early deaths attributed to air pollution every year. Wasn’t in the 1 in every 5 people who will have a lung condition in their lifetime. Or one of the 5.4 million people in the UK living with asthma.
 OK
## Where does the donation come from?
 
We are partnered with 6,000+ stores as well as dozens of providers across insurance, energy and broadband.
Because of this relationship, when you visit a retailer via Give as you Live Online and make a purchase, they give us a reward as a "thank you".
With this reward, we make a donation to the charity of your choice!
