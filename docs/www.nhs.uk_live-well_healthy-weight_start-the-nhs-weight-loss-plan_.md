## Type 2 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes causes the level of sugar in the blood to become too high.
It can lead to serious complications such as sight loss, kidney failure, heart attack and stroke. You can reduce your risk by eating more healthily, losing weight and being more physically active.
You may be at a higher risk if you:
* carry extra weight, especially around your middle
* are from South Asian, African-Caribbean or Black African descent
* have a parent, brother, sister or child with type 2 diabetes
To find out if you’re at risk of type 2 diabetes, take a couple of minutes to [check your risk score](https://riskscore.diabetes.org.uk/).
If you have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes - [get free NHS support online](https://healthyliving.nhs.uk/) to help you achieve and maintain a healthy weight.
### Did you know?
Small changes (like swapping sugary drinks for water or ditching sugar from your tea) can make a big difference in the long term.
## Get active
Being healthier is not just about what you eat – it's also about regular physical activity. Even 10 minutes a day counts!
Check out our tools and tips on weaving exercise into your daily routine.
[Get active](https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/get-active/)
## Why should I lose weight?
Gaining weight is often a gradual process – it happens over the years as a result of modern-day life and the odd unhealthy habit.
Extra weight causes fat to build up around vital organs, making it harder for the body to fight against diseases like cancer, heart disease and now COVID-19.
If you are overweight or living with obesity, lowering your weight can help reduce your risk of developing serious diseases.
You can learn more about obesity and [get support from Obesity UK](https://www.obesityuk.org.uk/support-groups), the leading charity dedicated to supporting people living with obesity.
### Did you know?
Veggies keep you full for longer. They are low in calories and high in fibre – they make great snacks too.
## Take care of your mind too
Your mental wellbeing is just as important as your physical health.
