 How to order a repeat prescription
If you take medicine regularly you'll usually have a repeat prescription.
This means you can order your medicine when you need it without having to see a GP until your next medicine review.
You might be able to ask your pharmacy for your medicine if your GP has set up this up (repeat dispensing). If not, you'll need to order your medicines from your GP surgery each time.
There are 3 ways to order a repeat prescription from your GP surgery.
## Using your NHS account
You can order a repeat prescription by logging into your account using the NHS app or NHS website.
If you're asked to nominate a pharmacy, you can only nominate a high street pharmacy.
You'll be able to collect your medicine in person when it's ready. Some high street pharmacies also deliver.

Ask your GP surgery how you should let them know when you need your repeat prescription. They can send your request to a pharmacy.
You might be able to get your medicine sent to you if the pharmacy you have nominated offers that service. Or they might be able to let you know when it's ready to collect.
