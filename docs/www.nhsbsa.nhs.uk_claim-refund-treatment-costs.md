Claim a refund for treatment costs
# Claim a refund for treatment costs
You can claim a refund for any state-funded medically necessary treatment you paid for while visiting another country. 
Some countries ask patients to pay a contribution towards the cost of their care, such as for prescription costs. This means that you may need to pay for services that you would normally get for free on the NHS. This is known as a co-payment or patient contribution.
Depending on the country you visit, you may be expected to pay for some, or all, of your treatment upfront and then claim a refund afterwards.
You can claim back the difference between the total bill and the co-payment, but the co-payment is not refundable. 
Keep all receipts and any paperwork. You or your insurance company may need them if you apply for a refund.

### What you’ll need to provide
To support your claim form, you’ll need to provide:
* all original invoices
* proof of any payments that you have made
Each individual treatment period should be submitted on a separate claim form and must include the signed and dated declaration. 
We retain this information once your claim is settled. 
Charges will be reimbursed according to the rules and rates of the country where the treatment was received. These are based on what a resident of that country would need to pay.
### If you have not paid any treatment costs
You cannot claim a refund if you have not paid for treatment, as you’ll need to provide receipts to make a claim. 
We cannot reimburse the costs for any treatment received at a private facility.
If you used your UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC), UK European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), or a Provisional Replacement Certificate (PRC), any costs attached to this process will be automatically refunded to the country in which you received treatment.
