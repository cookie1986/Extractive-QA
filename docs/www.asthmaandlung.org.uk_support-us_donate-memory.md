# Donate in memory
We have a number of ways that you can pay tribute to a loved one, like setting up a donation page in their memory.
With the continued support of donations made in memory, we’re transforming lung health in the UK. Our support helps people who struggle to breathe. Our research finds new ways to prevent, treat and cure lung conditions. Our campaigns fight for lung health to become a priority.
