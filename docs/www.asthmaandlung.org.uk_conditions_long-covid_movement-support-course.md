In this course of videos, we help people with Long COVID to keep moving and get more active.
## About this course
In this course of videos, we’ll be guiding you through some exercises to help build your physical strength while recovering from Long COVID.
These exercises, and the breathing techniques from our [breathlessness videos](/conditions/long-covid/1-introduction-breathlessness "1. Introduction to breathlessness"), will help you to manage your breathlessness. By moving your body, you can make your muscles stronger, and your muscles will start to use oxygen more efficiently. This will then make your breathlessness easier to manage.
These exercises shouldn’t be used in place of any medicines that you’ve been prescribed or any exercises that your physiotherapist has given you, if you have one. However, you may find that some of these exercises are similar to some your physio may have given you.
Think about how to fit these exercises into your day. It might be useful to plan these for when you’ll have the time to do them and when you think you’ll have the energy.
> ### Don’t do too much too soon
> 
> 
> Some people with Long COVID find they feel very tired for a few days after doing exercise and are unable to do their usual everyday activities. If this happens, this is a sign that you have done too much. You should slow down and rest more. If you feel able to try out any exercises, make sure you build up slowly, listen to your body and work at a level that is right for you.

## Important safety message
Please watch this short safety message before you begin the Movement modules.
 
## Long COVID activity tracker
It can be useful to plan out and record your activity. [Download our activity tracker](http://www.blf.org.uk/sites/default/files/Tracking_your_activity_with_long_covid_final.pdf), to help you think about how you are feeling and how your activity has affected your energy levels.
By recording your activity, you’ll be able to link your current energy levels to things you’ve done in the past.
**This will help you plan any physical activity you might want to do around the rest of your daily tasks.**
