# Vegetarian Eatwell Guide
![](https://vegsoc.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/vegetable-box-750x580.jpg)
The government has produced an Eatwell Guide to advise on healthy eating. It is essential public health information, but it contains meat and fish. That’s why the Vegetarian Society has adapted the guide for vegetarians. It applies to anyone over the age of two.
