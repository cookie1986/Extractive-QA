## Test your breathing
## Questionnaire for breathing
##### To become more aware of your breathing pattern try this short
questionnaire:
 
1. When sitting resting, do you breath through
Your Nose?Your Mouth?
**You breathe through your nose:** Breathing through your nose is excellent, well done. Your nose is very important as it cleans, warms and moistens the air that goes into your lungs, it also controls the flow of air going through to your lungs.
**You breathe through your mouth:** Mouth breathing is not good while you are sitting relaxed. It allows too much air to pass into your lungs and the air is cold and dry too. This exposes you more to pollutants and particles that you might be allergic to, which can be harmful for your lungs. You should breathe through your nose while resting. Your nose is very important as it cleans, warms and moistens the air that goes into your lungs; it also controls the flow of air going through to your lungs.
2. Can you hear your breathing?
YesNo
**You answered Yes:** Hearing your breathing may mean that you are breathing too much. The size of the breath coming in and out of your lungs is too big which is why you can hear it. Your breath size needs to be smaller so that you cannot hear it.
 **You answered No:** Breathing quietly is good, this should mean that the size of the breaths you take in and out are a good size.
3. How many breaths do you take in one minute?
8-1213-1617+
**You take 8-12 breaths per minute:** your breathing rate is perfect.
**You take 13-16 breaths per minute:** Your breathing rate is a little higher than it should be, your breathing rate should be 8-12 breaths.
**You take 17+ breaths per minute:**Your breathing rate is high. This means you are breathing too much as you are breathing in and out too fast. You are breathing twice the rate you should be, your breathing rate should be 8-12 breaths.
4. Place one hand on your tummy and one on your chest:
1. Does your tummy expand when you breathe in?
YesNo
**You answered Yes:** You can feel your tummy moving which means that your diaphragm should be working well. Your diaphragm should be doing 80% of the work of breathing. This means your tummy rises and falls as you breathe in and out and your upper chest stays still.
**You answered No:**Your diaphragm is not working well as you cannot feel your tummy rising and falling as you breathe. Your diaphragm should be doing 80% of the work of breathing. This should mean that your tummy rises and falls as you breathe in and out and your upper chest stays still.
2. Does your upper chest move when you breathe in?
YesNo
**You answered Yes:**Your upper chest moves as you breathe in and out, which means you are using the wrong muscles to breathe with. Your upper chest should not move while you are breathing at rest and you are relaxed. Your tummy should be rising and falling as you breathe in and out and your upper chest should be still. Your upper chest should only move when you increase your activity. Go to treatment to see how to get your diaphragm working.
**You answered No:** Your upper chest stays still when you are breathing at rest, which means you are using the correct muscles when you breathe. It is, however, important that your upper chest does move when you do exercise.
5. Time how long you can hold your breath.  
Did you hold your breath for:
Less than 30 secsMore than 30 secs
**You held your breath for less than 30 seconds:**holding your breath measures your drive to breathe. You have a strong feeling of wanting to breathe after a short period of time which may indicate that you breathe too much.
**You held your breath for more than 30 seconds:**holding your breath measures your drive to breathe, you held your breath for a sufficient amount of time.
6. Do you sigh or yawn a lot?
YesNo
**You answered Yes:**Sighing and yawning is a sneaky way of bringing more air in and out of your lungs. As your breathing pattern improves you should find you sigh or yawn less.
**You answered No:**Sighing and yawning is a sneaky way of bringing more air in and out of the lungs. You don't do that - excellent!
