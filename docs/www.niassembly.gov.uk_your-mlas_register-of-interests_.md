# Register of Members’ Interests
The purpose of the Register of Members’ Interests is to provide information on any financial interest or other registerable interest which might reasonably be thought by others to influence a Member’s actions, speeches or votes in the Assembly, or actions taken in his or her capacity as a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Members are required to keep that overall purpose in mind when registering their interests. The 'Guide to the Rules Relating to the Conduct of Members' sets out in detail the rules governing the registration and declaration of Members' Interests, as well as offering guidance on their practical application.
**Open Data Services**
The [Register of Interests](http://data.niassembly.gov.uk/register.asmx "Link to the Open Data services available for the Register of Interests") is available in XML and JSON Web Services to provide easy and transparent access to data. 
[You can find more information on the Northern Ireland Assembly's Open Data services on this link.](http://data.niassembly.gov.uk/ "A link to the Northern Ireland Assembly's Open Data services")
