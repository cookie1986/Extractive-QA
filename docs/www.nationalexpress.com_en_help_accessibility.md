## Code of practice for disabled customers
This is where you can discover all you need to know about accessibility and inclusion for customers at National Express and how we work to make your journey better.
We are committed to continually improving the service we provide to the millions of customers travelling with us every year. We will always listen to customer feedback to make sure we get things right. We monitor the processes we have in place and amend them as necessary to maintain high levels of service for our disabled customers.
You can contact our Assisted Travel Team on 03717 818181 to talk through your needs (lines open 8am - 8pm, 7 days a week), or [email us using our assisted travel form](https://www.nationalexpress.com/en/help/contact/assisted-travel "Assisted Travel"). It isn’t a requirement to book your assistance in advance but it will help us to provide your assistance and ensure you have the best possible experience with us. **Please note, seat belt extenders can also be requested via our Assisted Travel Team.**
![Guide dog](/media/5527/guide-dog.jpg)   ![Wheelchair lift in use](/media/5542/wheelchair-on-coach.jpg)  
 
We are committed to ensuring that every customer is treated with respect by everyone at National Express. Our team are trained to deliver great customer service which includes a commitment to equality and specific disability awareness training.
Our aim is to deliver an outstanding service to every customer, every time and to ensure everyone can make use of our services, as long as it is safe to do so.
We also give advice and guidance to our station customer service teams and drivers on how they can best serve our disabled customers.
### 

 Journey assistance cards
We have created a selection of journey assistance cards for passengers. These explain to our staff and drivers any need for assistance or exemptions from requirements, eg, if unable to wear a face covering.
**[Download journey assistance cards](/media/9505/assisted-travel-cards-11-2022.pdf "Assisted-Travel-Cards-11-2022.pdf")**
## Information and guidelines for wheelchair users
We welcome feedback regarding the accessibility and inclusion of our services and strive to take this on board to help to continually make improvements. We ensure that all of our drivers, coach station and ticket office teams are reminded to review our policies so that we can continue to welcome customers for a safe and comfortable journey.
We advise that our customers who are wheelchair users book travel in advance, although this is not essential. This will allow us to carry out the following checks:
* **that the wheelchair is compatible with the space on the coach**
* **that the combined weight of the customer and the wheelchair do not exceed the maximum weight capacity of being lifted by the wheelchair lift**
* **that the locations at which the customer plans to board and alight the coach from are accessible stops at which the wheelchair lift can be deployed**
* **that the specific coach on which the customer plans to travel is not already fully booked**
We recommend you contact us on the following local rate telephone number: 03717 81 81 81 (lines open 8am - 8pm 7 days a week) 36 hours in advance of travel. This will ensure we are able to carry out these checks. If you book same-day travel we will make all reasonable efforts to carry out these checks on the day. If these are clear, we will be able to complete the booking.

## Sunflower Lanyard Scheme
We support the Sunflower Lanyard Scheme.
Living with a Hidden Disabilities can make daily life more demanding for many people, but it can be difficult for others to recognise, acknowledge or understand the challenges faced. The Hidden Disabilities Sunflower suggests happiness, positivity and strength and intends to allow everyone with Hidden Disabilities to choose to be subtly visible when they need to be.
If you have a hidden disability and would like a lanyard, please contact our assisted travel team on 03717 81 81 81 (lines open 8am - 8pm 7 days a week), or email using our assisted travel form. Further information on the Sunflower Lanyard Scheme can be found [here](https://hiddendisabilitiesstore.com/about-hidden-disabilities-sunflower "Hidden disabilities store").
 
## The Code of Practice
This code applies to all disabled customers and those with reduced mobility. We recognise that disabilities and/or conditions are not always visible. If you have any reasonable adjustments or accessibility requirements please let us know and we will always aim to help wherever we can.
### 

 1. Arranging assistance
**Our Assisted Travel Team**
Our dedicated Assisted Travel Team offers travel support by providing journey and booking information and, subject to availability, they can reserve a front seat and/or the dedicated wheelchair space. They can discuss and agree on the level of assistance that may be required at each stage of your journey and advise you on what can be provided.
To discuss any adjustments or accessibility requirements you may have, contact our Assisted Travel Team by calling 03717 81 81 81, (lines are open 7 days a week 8am - 8pm) or email using our [assisted travel form](https://www.nationalexpress.com/en/help/contact/assisted-travel "Assisted travel form"). Further contact details are provided at the end of this Code of Practice. When getting in touch, simply explain your requirements and once an advisor has assessed the details, they will give you all the information you will need for your journey.
Please make sure you give us as much information as possible before you travel as this will help us deliver the right service on the day.
**Booking Assistance**
When booking your assistance we recommend you let us know what contact our Assisted Travel Team at least 36 hours before you intend to travel (wherever possible). We can then discuss any assistance needs you have. The more information you provide and the further in advance we can discuss it with you, the better prepared we will be to meet your needs when you travel with us. However, if you do book travel on the same day or less than 36 hours in advance, we will still make all reasonable efforts to meet your needs for when you travel with us.
### 

 2. Travel with wheelchairs
**Access to our coaches**
Wheelchair access to our coaches is via a lift located at the front of the coach. Our wheelchair accessible coaches have an extra-large entrance and a flat floor throughout the coach to aid mobility.
We regularly invest in new coaches and all of our fleet now has a wheelchair lift at the front entrance.
**Standing on the wheelchair lift**
We are not able to permit customers or colleagues to stand on the lift whilst in use. To assist boarding if you are unable to use the steps, we have invested in manual wheelchairs, stored in the luggage hold of each of our coaches. The wheelchair will be used to seat you when the lift is used and provide step-free access onto the coach. Please visit the below section on Travelling in a National Express Wheelchair and transferring to a seat.
**Wheelchair users travelling in a coach seat**
For customers who can and/or would prefer to transfer from their wheelchair to a coach seat, we can transport lightweight wheelchairs safely stowed in the luggage hold of the coach. A wheelchair can be safely stowed in the luggage hold when:
(i) it is capable of being folded and unfolded  
(ii) if it can’t be folded, it can be dismantled and reassembled by the passenger or their carer/companion  
(iii) if it has a battery, the battery is a dry fuel cell or gel fuel cell or lithium battery;  
(iv) it has no assistance or auxiliary aids which would make it unsafe for stowage; and  
(v) it weighs no more than 20kg.
We will also need to check that the stops at which you plan to board and alight the coach are wheelchair accessible so that the coach lift can be deployed.
We therefore recommend that a customer wishing to transfer from their wheelchair to a coach seat books with us at least 36 hours in advance of travel, by contacting our Assisted Travel team. This will allow us to check that your wheelchair (and ancillary equipment if applicable) is safe for stowage in the luggage hold and that the stops you plan to use are wheelchair accessible and the lift can be deployed.
However, if you book travel on the same day or less than 36 hours in advance we will make all reasonable efforts to complete these required steps within the time period provided.
**Wheelchair users travelling in their wheelchairs in the designated wheelchair space**
We recognise that..,.The wheelchair space on our coaches is fitted with a seat which can be quickly and easily removed. We recognise that some wheelchair users can, must, or prefer to, travel in a coach seat rather than in their wheelchair. Having a seat in the space means both disabled customers and other customers can use this seat when the space is not required by wheelchair users travelling in their wheelchair.
For those customers who want to travel in their wheelchair, we need to carry out the checks listed in our Wheelchair User Guidelines (available from our Assisted Travel Team or here) to ensure that we are able to provide travel (the “Requirements”). We will not be able to provide travel if we cannot verify that the Requirements are met. We therefore recommend that a passenger planning to travel in their wheelchair makes a booking at least 36 hours in advance of travel by contacting our Assisted Travel Team to give us time to carry out the necessary checks. However, if you book travel on the day or less than 36 hours in advance we will make reasonable efforts to complete these required steps within the time period provided.
When notifying us, we ask that you give us details of the size, make and model of the wheelchair you will be travelling in and any modifications you might have made to the wheelchair so we can make the necessary checks. These checks relate specifically to whether the wheelchair can be safely secured in the wheelchair space on our coaches.
If we have previously confirmed the compatibility of a particular wheelchair, this information will be stored on our database, so we should be able to reconfirm compatibility at the point you call our Assisted Travel Team, or very soon thereafter.
**Travelling in a National Express Wheelchair and transferring to a seat**
All of our coaches have wheelchairs which are stowed in the luggage hold and are available for passengers to use to board the coach and transfer to a seat using the passenger lift. To board in this way, we will be required to make the checks outlined below prior to your journey
(i) that the stops you wish you board and alight are stops where the passenger lift can be safely deployed.   
(ii) that there is space on the coach.
We therefore recommend that a passenger wishing to board the coach using a National Express makes a booking at least 36 hours in advance of travel, by contacting our Assisted Travel Team, however customers can turn up and travel without pre-booking.
**Limitations on Travel**
While our coaches are wheelchair accessible, the toilets on our coaches are not. Should you have any requirements in this respect, please advise our Assisted Travel Team when discussing your journey. If you need to use the toilet during your journey, ask the driver to make a stop at the next available/appropriate station.
### 

 3. Travel with Mobility Scooters
While customers cannot travel in their mobility scooters, we do accept small lightweight mobility scooters that can be safely stowed in the luggage hold of the coach. A mobility scooter can be safely stowed in the luggage hold when:
(i) it is capable of being folded and unfolded;  
(ii) it can be dismantled and reassembled by the passenger or their carer/companion (if it can’t be folded);  
(iii) the battery is a dry fuel cell or gel fuel cell or lithium battery;  
(iv) it has no assistance or auxiliary aids which would make it unsafe for stowage; and  
(v) the heaviest part of the mobility scooter weighs no more than 20kg.
We recommend that a customer planning to stow a mobility scooter in the luggage hold makes a booking at least 36 hours in advance of travel, by contacting our Assisted Travel Team. This will allow us to check that your mobility scooter (and ancillary equipment if applicable) is safe for stowage in the luggage hold. However, if you wish to book travel on the day or less than 36 hours in advance we will make all reasonable efforts to complete these required steps within the time period provided.
In order to carry out the above checks, we will need you to give us details of the size, make and model of the mobility scooter you will be travelling with.
We will advise you either at the time of booking or by calling you back, about the suitability of your mobility scooter for carriage in the luggage hold of our coaches. If we have previously confirmed the compatibility of a particular mobility scooter, this information will be stored on our database, so we should be able to reconfirm compatibility at the point you call our Assisted Travel Team, or very soon thereafter.
### 

 4. Assistance Services

* We can only offer assistance in the station or at a stop where we have National Express staff and during the hours we have staff on-site. If you need assistance in the station or at a stop, just let us know by contacting our Assisted Travel Team. We will then let you know if the station/stop you will be using is staffed. If it is, we will do all we can to make sure that a member/s of our team are there when you get on or off your coach (during the advertised opening hours).
