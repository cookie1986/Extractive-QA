## Frequently asked questions
[**How do Give as you Live Instore cards work?**](#answer1)
Give as you Live Instore store cards allow you to raise an average of 3% in free funds for your favourite charity when you buy or top-up online.
We have a range of cards and e-vouchers available from popular stores including Sainsbury's, Marks & Spencer, Waitrose & Partners, Morrisons and ASDA.
Purchase store cards for yourself or as a thoughtful gift. Many of our cards are reloadable, so you can raise a free donation each time you top-up.
The scheme is managed by Give as you Live Instore with the card distribution and payment process handled by our partner, Hawk Incentives Limited, who are a leading distributor of corporate gift cards, e-codes and gift vouchers.
[**How do I purchase store cards?**](#answer2)
This is a members-only scheme available to all charity supporters and to Give as you Live Instore members. You can register for the scheme via the Give as you Live Instore website.
[**Is there any charge for signing up?**](#answer3)
There is no extra charge for shopping using a store card with our retailers. The donation is made for free by Give as you Live Instore to your chosen charity.
Postage costs and transaction fees (debit card payments are free) will be included upon checkout.
[**Is there a cost to the charity?**](#answer4)
The Give as you Live Instore store cards scheme is totally FREE for charities, as are the marketing materials we make available.
[**How will I know how much I have raised for my charity?**](#answer5)
When you browse our website you will be shown the donation rate percentage e.g. if you purchase a card which generates a 3% donation and load the card with £100, you will generate a £3 donation.
It can take up to 30 days for your card to appear in your Give as you Live Instore account, but it is usually quicker. As soon as the card appears in your account we will also email you to confirm the donation raised, and add the donation to your Give as you Live Instore account.
[**How do I add money to a reloadable card?**](#answer6)
When you order a card, an initial amount is uploaded. If you wish to top-up the balance on your card, you can do this by logging into your Give as you Live Instore account. Here you will see an 'Add funds' button next to any reloadable cards you already possess. When you click 'Add funds', you'll be taken to our partner's website where you can top up your card.
[**What donation will my charity receive?**](#answer7)
Every purchase or reload of a store card or e-voucher generates a donation based on the amount you upload. You can see individual donation rates for each retailer by [browsing our cards](/shop).
[**Where can I shop with my store card?**](#answer8)
We offer cards for a wide range of popular retailers including Sainsbury's, Marks & Spencer, Morrisons and ASDA.
You can see all of our participating retailers by [browsing our cards](/shop). When you click a retailer, you will be taken to a page which details where you can redeem your card.
[**How do I pay using my store card/digital e-gift card?**](#answer9)
The store cards are a standard method of payment. Just hand the card to the check-out assistant or, if you are using a self-service checkout, swipe your card to pay for your goods.
Digital e-gift vouchers can be used in a similar way and provide a unique code via email that contains details of the amount of cash that can be spent.
[**I am unable to pay with a credit card or Amex card on the website. Why is this?**](#answer10)
All personal credit card payment methods and Amex have been removed from the site. Please make your payment using a debit card.
[**I am trying to place an order and I am receiving a 'card type not supported' error when entering my card number. Why is this?**](#answer11)
If you are using a credit card, credit cards have been blocked on this site. Please make your payment with a debit card instead.
If you are using a debit card, certain issuing banks sometimes use 16 digit card numbers which were previously associated with credit cards. As we have blocked credit cards on this website, if our system is identifying your payment method as a credit card, you will not be able to proceed. Please use an alternative debit card, or contact our Customer Care team who will be able to help you.
