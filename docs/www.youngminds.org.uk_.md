## #EndTheWait
![Information about our End The Wait campaign action. Text reads: 'YoungMinds is bringing the Young People's Lobby to Parliament in support of #EndTheWait. Where? The Houses of Parliament. When? Monday 20th March 1-3pm'](/media/1pmfxffc/invite-your-mp-to-etw.jpg?quality=55)
**Invite your MP to our #EndTheWait event in Parliament**
Last year, over 28,000 young people told us about the changes that need to happen to make the world a better place for their mental health.
**We listened and now it's time the Government do the same.**
That's why we’re hosting an #EndTheWait event in Parliament. It's a chance for young people to tell decision-makers exactly why we need better mental health support.

## Frequently asked questions
### 
How can YoungMinds help me?
We provide young people with tools to look after their mental health. Our website is full of [advice and information](/young-person/find-help/ "Find help") on what to do if you're struggling with how you feel. We empower parents and adults who work with young people, to be the best support they can be to the young people in their lives. And we give young people the space and confidence to get their voices heard and change the world we live in. Together, we can create a world where no young person feels alone with their mental health.
 
Find out more [about our work and impact](/about-us/ "About us"). 
### 
What is mental health?
We all have mental health, just like we all have physical health. It’s about how we think, feel and act. Sometimes we feel well, and sometimes we don’t. When our mental health is good, we feel motivated and able to take on challenges and new experiences. But when our mental health is not so good, we can find it much harder to cope.
 
[Find out more about mental health](/young-person/coping-with-life/what-is-mental-health/ "What is mental health?").
### 
How do I know if I have a 'mental health problem'?
We all have good days and bad days, but when negative thoughts and feelings start to affect your daily life and stop you doing the things you enjoy, or your ability to feel ok, this means you probably need some support with your mental health. For example, nearly everyone gets anxious before an exam, a job interview or a first date. But if we feel anxious all the time, constantly worrying that the worst could happen, and this stops us sleeping well or meeting up with friends, we might benefit from some help. Find out more about mental health.
 
[Understand more about mental health problems](/young-person/coping-with-life/what-is-mental-health/ "What is mental health?").
### 
Is YoungMinds part of CAMHS?
No, we are a charity that provides information and advice to young people, and parents and carers. Take a look at our [guide to support](/young-person/your-guide-to-support/ "Your guide to support") for information about how Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) work, including information on how you can get help from CAMHS, what happens at an assessment, what your rights are and more. We do **not** provide one-to-one support with CAMHS assessments, treatments or complaints.
If you're a parent or carer, you can find information about accessing Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) and other services on our [getting help page](/parent/parents-a-z-mental-health-guide/getting-help-for-your-child/ "Getting help for your child"). Or you can contact our [Parents Helpline](/parent/parents-helpline-and-webchat/ "Parents Helpline and Webchat") for more advice.
 
[Find out more about CAMHS](/young-person/your-guide-to-support/guide-to-camhs/ "Guide to CAMHS").
### 
How do you help parents?
We help parents and carers who are worried about their child’s mental health with tips, information and advice online and through our [Parents Helpline](/parent/parents-helpline-and-webchat/ "Parents Helpline and Webchat") service. Use our [helpfinder](/parent/find-help/ "Find help") to find the right support for you. 
### 
What support do you provide to adults working in the community?
Whether you work at a youth club, coach a sports team, or run extra-curricular activities outside of school, we know the positive and crucial role you play in the lives of young people. We have [information, tips and resources](/professional/community-support/ "Community support") for you to feel confident when responding to a young person's wellbeing needs.
