# Welsh elections: standing up for Welsh lungs
At some point in our lives, 1 in 5 of us will have a lung disease. Across the UK, millions more are at risk. As the only UK charity looking after the lungs of Wales, here's what will make the biggest difference to people living with lung conditions.
To improve lives, we need to do 4 things:
* [Better prevent lung conditions](/welsh-elections-prevent-it "Welsh elections: prevent it")
* [Better diagnose lung conditions](/welsh-elections-diagnose-it "Welsh elections: diagnose it")
* [Better treat lung conditions](/welsh-elections-treat-it "Welsh elections: treat it")
* [And help people live better with lung conditions](/welsh-elections-live-better-it "Welsh elections: live better with it")
There are simple things we can do. And you can pledge to do some of those things below.
## 
 Pledge 1: prevent it
I believe the next Senedd must work to deliver a Clean Air Act for Wales so we can all breathe clean air through healthy lungs

## 
 Pledge 2: diagnose it
I believe the next Senedd must roll out a nationwide programme for lung screening across Wales, so the best diagnosis is available to everyone

## 
 Pledge 3: treat it
Our health is paramount. We must have the best care available. The next Welsh government must deliver a new respiratory health delivery plan.

## 
 Pledge 4: live better with it
No matter where you are in Wales, if you need access to pulmonary rehabilitation, it should be available. I want the next Senedd to increase access to PR for everyone with mild COPD, bronchiectasis and IPF.
