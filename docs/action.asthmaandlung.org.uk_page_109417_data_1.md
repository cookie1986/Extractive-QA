# Respiratory Voices Network
Would you like to share your experiences of living with lung disease to shape future research? We need to hear from people affected by lung disease to understand what research will have the biggest impact for you.
Opportunities might include completing short surveys, attending focus groups or trialling the latest products to help people manage their lung condition.
We’ll email you a regular round up of opportunities to share your insights and you’re able to pick and choose which are of the most interest to you.
