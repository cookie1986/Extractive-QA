 Overview
You may be able to get a payment if you’ve been diagnosed with the asbestos-related disease, diffuse mesothelioma.
There are 2 types of payment you can claim for:
* diffuse mesothelioma payments (the ‘2008 scheme’)
* the Diffuse Mesothelioma Payment Scheme (DMPS)
You can claim DMPS if you cannot find the employer responsible for your contact with asbestos, or their insurer.
This guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/taliadau-mesothelioma-ymledol).
