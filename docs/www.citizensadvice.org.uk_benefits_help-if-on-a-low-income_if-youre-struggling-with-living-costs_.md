Get help with the cost of living
 This advice applies to
 
 [England](/resources-and-tools/about-this-site/location/)
 Print
 
If you don’t have enough money to live on, you might be able to get help to afford essentials like bills and food. This includes the Household Support Fund and cost of living payments.
You should check if you can claim benefits - you might be able to do this even if you work, have savings or own a home.
## If you owe money and you're struggling to pay
You should speak to the organisations you owe money to – they might let you pay smaller amounts or take a break from payments.
Don’t ignore bills or letters about money you owe.
You can [find out how to start dealing with your debts](/debt-and-money/help-with-debt/dealing-with-your-debts/check-your-debt-options/).
## Check what benefits you can get
You might be able to claim benefits or increase your current benefits if you’re:
* of working age and on a low income
* sick or disabled
* of State Pension age and on a low income
* a carer
* responsible for children
Lots of people miss out on benefits they’re entitled to - so it’s worth checking what you can get.
[Check what benefits you can get](/benefits/benefits-introduction/what-benefits-can-i-get/).
### Get your first benefit payment early
When you apply for benefits, you can usually ask to get your first payment early while you’re waiting for either:
* a decision on your application
* your first payment
This is called a 'short-term benefit advance'. You can get an advance for most benefits, including Universal Credit. You can’t get an advance for:
* Housing Benefit
* Attendance Allowance
* Disability Living Allowance (DLA)
* Personal Independence Payment (PIP)
* Child Benefit
* Guardian's Allowance
* Working or Child Tax credits
You’ll need to pay back the advance. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will take an amount off your future payments until you've paid it back. For Universal Credit, you can spread the repayments over 24 months. For other benefits, you’ll usually repay your advance over 12 weeks.
If you've applied for Universal Credit, you can [check how to get a Universal Credit advance payment](/benefits/universal-credit/claiming/get-advance-payment/).
If you’ve applied for a different benefit, contact the benefits office that's dealing with your claim. You can find their contact details on any letter or email you’ve had from them.
## Check if you'll get a cost of living payment
The government will send you a 'cost of living payment' if you:
* get certain benefits - for example, Universal Credit, Pension Credit, PIP or Attendance Allowance
* are over State Pension age and get Winter Fuel Payments
You can get as many cost of living payments as you're eligible for. For example, if you get Pension Credit, Attendance Allowance and Winter Fuel Payments, you’ll get 3 cost of living payments. You won't have to pay tax on them and they won't count as income when calculating your benefits.
### If you get benefits based on your income
In July and November 2022, the government gave cost of living payments to people who get benefits based on their income.
They'll give you another payment of £301 in spring 2023 if you get any of the following benefits:
* Universal Credit
* Pension Credit
* Working Tax Credit
* Child Tax Credit
* income-based Jobseekers Allowance
* income-related Employment and Support Allowance
* Income Support
You’ll only get another cost of living payment once - even if you get more than 1 of these benefits. 
We'll update our advice about the next payment when the government announce more details.
If you haven’t had the first or second cost of living payment, and you think you should have, you can [report a missing payment on GOV.UK](https://secure.dwp.gov.uk/report-a-missing-cost-of-living-payment/welcome).
If you’re not claiming any of these benefits yet, you should [check if you can claim benefits](/benefits/benefits-introduction/what-benefits-can-i-get/). It's worth starting a claim as soon as possible if you're eligible - this means you might be able to get the next cost of living payment.
### If you get a disability benefit
The government gave a £150 cost of living payment to people getting disability benefits in 2022. 
You'll get another £150 cost of living payment in summer 2023 if you get any of the following benefits:
* Disability Living Allowance
* Personal Independence Payment
* Attendance Allowance
* Armed Forces Independence Payment
* Constant Attendance Allowance
* War Pension Mobility Supplement
We'll update our advice about the next payment when the government announce more details.
### If you're over State Pension age and get Winter Fuel Payments
You'll either get a £300 or £150 cost of living payment, depending on your situation. You'll get this at the same time as your usual Winter Fuel Payment.
You’ll get a £300 cost of living payment if you live either:
* on your own
* with people who don’t qualify for a Winter Fuel Payment
If you live with someone else who qualifies for the Winter Fuel Payment, the amount you’ll get depends on whether either of you get any of the following:
* Pension Credit
* income-related Employment Support Allowance
* income-based Jobseeker's Allowance
If either you or the person you live with gets one of these benefits, you’ll both get £300 - as long as you’re not partners. If you’re partners, you’ll only get one £300 payment.
If neither of you gets one of these benefits, you’ll both get £150.
If you live in residential care and qualify for the Winter Fuel Payment, you'll get £150 unless you get any of these benefits.
#### Check if you need to apply for Winter Fuel Payments
You're usually entitled to Winter Fuel Payments if you’re of State Pension age in the third week of September. The State Pension age is 66.
You should start getting the Winter Fuel Payment automatically once you reach State Pension age. You might need to apply if you're in one of these situations:
* you don't get State Pension
* you don't get another benefit
* you live in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein
You can [find out how to apply for the Winter Fuel Payment on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/winter-fuel-payment/how-to-claim).
## Get help with your energy bills
The government are giving every household £400 off their electricity bill. This is called the Energy Bills Support Scheme. You don’t need to do anything to get the money and you won’t have to pay it back.
You’ll get the £400 in 6 instalments starting from October 2022. 
If you heat your home using alternative fuel, such as biomass or heating oil, the government will give you a £200 payment to help with your energy bills. This is called the Alternative Fuel Payment.
 [Check how you’ll receive the payments](/consumer/energy/energy-supply/get-help-paying-your-bills/grants-and-benefits-to-help-you-pay-your-energy-bills/).
### Check how the Energy Price Guarantee affects you
The government has put a limit for most households on the rates your supplier can charge you for gas and electricity. This is called the Energy Price Guarantee. 
You don’t need to do anything. The Energy Price Guarantee automatically applies to all types of energy tariffs. It started on 1 October 2022 and lasts until 31 March 2023. There’ll still be a limit after March 2023 - but the amount you pay for energy will go up.
[Find out how the Energy Price Guarantee affects you](/consumer/energy/energy-supply/get-a-better-energy-deal/choosing-energy-tariff/).
### Check what other help you can get
You might be able to get a fuel voucher or a grant from your energy supplier.
[Check if you can get help to pay your energy bills](/consumer/energy/energy-supply/get-help-paying-your-bills/grants-and-benefits-to-help-you-pay-your-energy-bills/).
### If you need somewhere to stay warm
You can ask your local council if they have a ‘warm space.’ These are public places which anyone can use to stay warm - for example, a library or town hall. You can [find out how to contact your local council on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council).
## Get help with essential costs
Your local council might help you pay for things like:
* your energy and water bills
* food
* essential items - for example, clothes or an oven
This help is known as 'welfare assistance' or the ‘Household Support Fund’. Each council runs their own scheme. You’ll need to check if you can get support and what type of support you can get.
Ask your local council if they run a welfare assistance or Household Support Fund scheme. You can [find out how to contact your local council on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council).
You don’t have to be getting benefits to get help from your local council. If you do get benefits, they won’t be affected if you start getting money from a welfare assistance or Household Support Fund scheme.
There are also other things you can do if you’re struggling to afford essentials like rent or food.
### Get help paying for rent, council tax and other bills
There are things you can do if you’re struggling to pay your rent and bills.
You can [check what help and support you can get with your rent and bills](/debt-and-money/budgeting/budgeting/get-help-with-bills/).
### Get help paying for food
If you're struggling to pay for food, you might be able to get a referral to a food bank.
You can [find out how to get help from a food bank](/debt-and-money/using-a-food-bank/).
#### If you have a child or are pregnant
You might be able to get a Healthy Start card to help you buy certain types of milk, infant formula, fruit and vegetables.
To get the Healthy Start card you must be at least 10 weeks pregnant or have a child under 4 years old. You must also be getting either:
* Universal Credit - but only if your household earns £408 a month or less
* Income Support
* income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance
* income-related Employment and Support Allowance - but only if you're pregnant
* Pension Credit
* Child Tax Credit - but only if your household earns £16,190 a year or less
If you get Child Tax Credit, you can’t get the card if you also get Working Tax Credit - unless you get the ‘run-on’ payment. Working Tax Credit run-on is the payment you get for 4 weeks after you stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit.
With the Healthy Start card you’ll get:
* £4.25 each week from week 10 of your pregnancy
* £8.50 each week for children from birth to 1 year old
* £4.25 each week for children between 1 and 4 years old
* free vitamins
You can [apply for the Healthy Start scheme on the NHS website](https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/apply-for-healthy-start/).
### Get help with health costs
You might be able to get help paying for NHS charges, for example:
* prescriptions
* dental treatment
* sight tests, glasses and contact lenses
* travel to NHS treatment
Check if you can [get help with health costs on the NHS Business Services Authority website](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/check-if-youre-eligible-help).
#### If you pay for regular prescriptions
If you can’t get help to pay for your prescriptions, you might be able to save money by buying a prepayment certificate. 
You’ll pay a fixed price for either 3 or 12 months. This will cover the cost of all the prescriptions you need during that time.
You can buy a prepayment certificate for unlimited prescriptions for:
* £30.25 for 3 months
* £108.10 for 12 months - you can pay this in 10 instalments of £10.81
You can [buy a prepayment certificate on the NHS Business Services Authority website](https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/buy-prescription-prepayment-certificate/start).
### Get help if you have children or are pregnant
You might be able to get help if:
* your child is at school
* your child is in childcare
* you’re pregnant or you’ve recently had a baby
#### If your child is at school
If you’re on a low income or claim certain benefits, you might be able to get help with the costs of sending your children to school.
For example, you could get:
* free school meals
* free transport to school
* a grant to help to buy school clothes or uniforms
* help with school trips
[Find out more about getting help with school costs](/family/education/help-with-school-costs/).
#### If your child is in childcare
If you’re on a low income or claim certain benefits, you might be able to get help with childcare costs. For example:
* if you work and claim Universal Credit, you might be able to claim back up to 85% of your childcare costs - you could get up to £646 a month for 1 child under 17 or £1,108 for 2 or more children
* if you have a 2 year old, you might be able to claim up to 15 hours of free childcare a week
If you work, you might be able to claim Tax-Free Childcare. This is a government scheme that helps parents with childcare costs like holiday clubs, childminders and nurseries. You can get up to:
* £2,000 a year for each child under 12
* £4,000 a year for each disabled child under 17
You won’t be able to receive Child Tax Credit, Working Tax Credit, Universal Credit or childcare vouchers if you get Tax-Free Childcare. Work out which option is best for you before applying.
If you have a 3 or 4 year old, you can get up to 570 free hours of early education or childcare a year. If you work, you might be able to claim more.
[Check what help you’re eligible for on the UK government’s Childcare Choices website](https://www.childcarechoices.gov.uk/).
#### If you’re pregnant or have a baby
You could get a one-off payment of £500 to help towards the costs of having a baby. You usually qualify if you get certain benefits and are having your first baby - you have to claim before your baby is 6 months old. [Find out how to apply for a Sure Start Maternity Grant on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/sure-start-maternity-grant).
You might be able to get support from a local baby bank - these offer free essentials like nappies, toys, shoes and clothes. 
Some food banks also provide nappies, baby wipes and baby food. 
Search online to find your nearest baby bank or food bank - or speak to your midwife or health visitor. 
[Find out more about maternity pay and parental rights](/work/maternity-and-parental-rights/check-your-maternity-and-parental-rights/).
### Get help with travel costs
Contact your local council to check if they offer free or discounted travel - for example, if you’re:
* in education
* on a work placement
* unemployed and looking for work
* a veteran
You can [find your local council on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council).
If you’re over State Pension age, you can get free bus travel. [Apply for an older person's bus pass on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-elderly-person-bus-pass).
If you’re 60 or over and live in London, you can get free travel on London’s transport services. You can [apply for a 60+ London Oyster photocard on the TFL website](https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/free-and-discounted-travel/60-plus-oyster-photocard).
If you’re disabled, you might be able to apply for a bus pass or railcard. You can [check if you can get help with the cost of transport](/benefits/sick-or-disabled-people-and-carers/help-for-disabled-travellers1/help-with-transport-costs/help-with-the-cost-of-transport-if-youre-disabled/).
### Get help with pets
If you’re using a food bank, you might be able to ask for some things, like pet food. Check with your local food bank if they’re able to help.
You can also check if there’s a pet food bank in your area. Ask your local vet or pet shop, or search online for 'pet food bank' and your local town.
You might be able to find free pet food collection points at your local supermarket, pet store or animal charity.
#### Get help with vet care
You might be eligible for free or reduced vet care from Blue Cross if you:
* get certain means-tested benefits
* live close to one of their hospitals or clinics
[Check if you can get free or reduced vet care on the Blue Cross website](https://www.bluecross.org.uk/veterinary).
You also might be able to get free or reduced vet care from charities such as RSPCA and PDSA.
[Check if you can get free or reduced vet care on the RSPCA website](https://www.rspca.org.uk/whatwedo/yourlocal).
[Check if you can get free or reduced vet care on the PDSA website](https://www.pdsa.org.uk/pet-help-and-advice/eligibility).
#### Get help with vet bills

If you can’t set up an affordable payment plan, you should [get debt advice](/about-us/contact-us/contact-us/contact-us/). Your vet might decide to stop treating your pet if you owe money. 
## Work out your budget
You should use our budgeting tool to help you understand:
* what money you've got coming in and what you have going out
* where you might be able to cut costs
You can [use our budgeting tool](/debt-and-money/budgeting/budgeting/work-out-your-budget/).
## Apply for a charitable grant

You can [check what help you can get from local and national charities on the Turn2us website](https://grants-search.turn2us.org.uk/). You’ll need to know your postcode.
## If you’re over 55 and have a personal pension
You might be able to take some money from your pension savings to help pay for essential costs or to pay off your debts.
You should think about whether taking money from your pension is the best financial decision for you. Taking money from your pension will mean you have less income when you retire. If you’re getting benefits, taking money from your pension could affect your claim.
You can [get free guidance on your pension options from Pension Wise](https://www.pensionwise.gov.uk/en). They’ll explain the different options so you can decide which is best for you.
You should also get financial advice before taking any money from your pension savings - you’ll have to pay. 
You can [check how to find a financial adviser](/debt-and-money/getting-financial-advice/) - they can tell you which option is best for you.
## If you’re finding things difficult
Your mental health is as important as your physical health. You should talk to your GP if your money problems are affecting your mental health. 
You can [find other ways to get help with your mental health on the Mind website](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/guides-to-support-and-services/seeking-help-for-a-mental-health-problem/where-to-start/).
