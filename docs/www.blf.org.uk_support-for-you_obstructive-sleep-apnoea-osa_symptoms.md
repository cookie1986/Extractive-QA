# Symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)
Symptoms of OSA can disrupt and affect your everyday life. On this page, we describe the most common symptoms of OSA.
Some symptoms happen when you’re asleep, and others when you’re awake. Not everyone with OSA will experience all of them. Remember: OSA can be serious if it’s not diagnosed and treated. 
### Symptoms and signs of OSA when asleep include:
* loud snoring
* stopping breathing or struggling to breathe
* feeling of choking or gasping
* tossing and turning
* sudden jerky body movements
* waking up a lot during the night
* snorting while you sleep.
If you have a partner, they might be more aware of your snoring and pauses in your breathing when you’re asleep than you are. It’s a good idea to ask them to record (using a mobile phone or another recording device) your breathing at night, or to note down any of the symptoms you’re experiencing.

### Symptoms of OSA when awake include:
* waking up sleepy and unrefreshed
* headache when you wake up
* difficulty concentrating and feeling groggy
* poor memory
* feeling depressed, irritable or other changes of mood
* poor co-ordination
* loss of sex drive.
