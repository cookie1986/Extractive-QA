# Thrush in men and women
**Thrush is a common yeast infection that affects men and women. It's usually harmless but it can be uncomfortable and keep coming back. It is not classed as a sexually transmitted infection (STI).**
## Check if you have thrush
### Thrush symptoms in women
* white [vaginal discharge](/conditions/vaginal-discharge/) (often like cottage cheese), which does not usually smell
* itching and irritation around the vagina
* soreness and stinging during sex or when you pee
### Thrush symptoms in men
* irritation, burning and redness around the head of the penis and under the foreskin
* a white discharge (like cottage cheese)
* an unpleasant smell
* difficulty pulling back the foreskin
### Thrush in other areas
Thrush can affect other areas of skin, such as the armpits, groin and between the fingers.
This usually causes a red, itchy or painful rash that scales over with white or yellow discharge. The rash may not be so obvious on darker skin.
Sometimes thrush causes no symptoms at all.

### 
Non-urgent advice: See a GP if:
* you have the symptoms of thrush for the first time
* you're under 16 or over 60
* thrush keeps coming back (more than 4 times in 12 months)
* treatment has not worked
* you're pregnant or breastfeeding
* you have thrush and a weakened immune system – for example, because of diabetes, HIV or chemotherapy
You may also be able to get help from a sexual health clinic if you think you have thrush.

### What happens at your appointment
The GP will want to confirm it's thrush and rule out other infections.
You'll be asked about your symptoms.
If it's not clear it's thrush:
* a doctor or nurse may look at your vagina, penis or skin
* a cotton bud may be wiped over the discharge to test for other infections
## Thrush treatment
You'll usually need antifungal medicine to get rid of thrush. This can be a tablet you take, a tablet you insert into your vagina (pessary) or a cream to relieve the irritation.
Thrush should clear up within 7 to 14 days of starting treatment.
You do not need to treat partners unless they have symptoms.
### Recurring thrush
You might need to take treatment for longer (for up to 6 months) if you keep getting thrush (you get it more than 4 times in 12 months).
A GP can help identify if something is causing your thrush, such as your period or sex.
They'll recommend how often you should use treatment.
## A pharmacist can help with thrush
You can buy antifungal medicine from pharmacies if you've had thrush diagnosed in the past and you know the symptoms.
A pharmacist can recommend the best treatment for you. Ask if they have a private area to talk if you're embarrassed.
You should not use antifungal medicine more than twice in 6 months without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor.

## Things you can do yourself to ease discomfort and prevent thrush returning
### 
 Do
* use water and emollient (like E45 cream) instead of soap to wash the affected area
* dry properly after washing
* wear cotton underwear
* avoid sex until thrush has cleared up if sex is uncomfortable
### 
 Don’t
* do not use soaps or shower gels
* do not use douches or deodorants on your vagina or penis
* do not wear tight underwear or tights
### 
 
 Important
If you have sex during treatment, be aware that antifungal creams can damage condoms and diaphragms. This means your contraception might not work.
## What causes thrush
Thrush is not classed as a sexually transmitted infection (STI), but it can be triggered by sex.
Thrush is caused by a fungus called candida that is normally harmless.
Thrush tends to grow in warm, moist conditions and develops if the balance of bacteria changes.
This can happen if:
* your skin is irritated or damaged
* you're taking antibiotics
* you have poorly controlled diabetes
* you have a weakened immune system (for example, because of HIV or chemotherapy)
* you're having hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
* you're pregnant
