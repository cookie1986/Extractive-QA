It’s so important as a carer to take time for yourself. In this section, we talk about how you can look after yourself, whether that’s your health, work and life balance, or your finances.

## Carer’s assessment
A carer’s assessment can be carried out by your local council or health service. Each UK nation has its own system of assessment. The aim of the assessment will be to help you get the support that you need. You may be asked questions about: 
* How your caring role affects your life and wellbeing
* Your own health (physical and mental)
* Your feelings about caring
* Your work and relationships
* Your housing
* Planning for emergencies
From this, they’ll work out what extra support you may be entitled to. You can find more details about the [carer’s assessment at Carers UK.](https://www.carersuk.org/help-and-advice/practical-support/getting-care-and-support/carers-assessment)
## Financial help
### Carer’s allowance
If you look after someone for 35 hours a week or more, you may be eligible for Carer’s Allowance. You do not have to live with or be related to the person you care for. Your eligibility is based on your circumstances, such as:
* your age
* whether you work and what you earn
* whether you get other benefits.
### Carer’s Credit
You could get [Carer’s Credit](https://www.gov.uk/carers-credit) if you care for someone for at least 20 hours a week. You automatically get Carer’s Credit if you get Carer’s Allowance, or child benefits for a child under the age of 12.
Carer’s Credit is a national insurance credit. So, if you have to stop work due to your caring responsibilities, contributions will still be paid. This means you can take on caring responsibilities without affecting your ability to qualify for the state pension.
## Balancing work and caring
If you are working full time or part-time whilst caring, it may be hard to juggle everything you need to do. It may be a good idea to tell colleagues about your situation, even having someone to talk to can be helpful. 
It will help to speak to your employer about your caring responsibilities. They will understand the circumstances, and some companies even have a carers policy in place.
If your employer does have a carer’s policy in place, you could be entitled to things such as: 
* carers’ leave (this might be paid or unpaid)
* time off for taking the person you care for to appointments (paid or unpaid)
* a carers’ support group or contact.
## Your health and wellbeing
Living with a lung condition can affect mental as well as physical health. This goes for carers too. It’s common to feel [anxious](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/looking-after-your-mental-health/anxiety), stressed or have symptoms of [depression](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/looking-after-your-mental-health/depression). You may even sometimes feel resentment or guilt as a carer. **Mind** has great tips on [how to look after yourself as a carer.](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/helping-someone-else/carers-friends-family-coping-support/looking-after-yourself/)
Caring can be tiring both physically and mentally. There are ways to look after yourself, such as talking to your GP, taking breaks, and getting enough sleep. Carers UK has more information on [looking after your health](https://www.carersuk.org/help-and-advice/health/looking-after-your-health) as a carer. 
Remember that family, friends and other carers can help you. Getting out to meet others will help you as well as the person you care for. You can also find lots of [tips from other carers about how to look after yourself and your emotions.](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/carers/tips-from-carers#emotions)
> Keep as social as you can, go to groups, coffee mornings, dancing, anything to meet other people. I reckon a lot of the benefits of our exercise group come from socialising. *Dave*

## Making difficult decisions
You may want to think about a lasting power of attorney covering health and welfare. If the person you care for nominates you, you will be able to tell their health care professionals about their wishes and be able to make decisions on their behalf if they can’t.
Planning for the final stages of caring is particularly difficult. Have a look at our information on [thinking and planning ahead](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/end-of-life/thinking-ahead). It covers what you can expect if the person you care for is reaching the end of their life, and what you might need to do. This includes planning end of life care and putting their affairs in order. 
You might also want to talk to health care professionals about the options available locally, such as helping you care at home and care in a hospice or hospital.
## When caring ends
Your caring role is likely to change over time, and it is hard to adjust when it comes to an end. Read more about [caring for a loved one at the end of life.](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/end-of-life/caring-for-a-loved-one)
When the person you care for dies, your feelings and reactions will be unique to you, but a range of support is available: 
* [Dying matters](http://www.dyingmatters.org/page/coping-bereavement) is an organisation that aims to help people talk more openly about bereavement.
* [Carers UK](https://britishlfuk.sharepoint.com/sites/Services/Health Advice/Health advice content/Asthma + Lung UK health advice/Website and print content/Caring for someone with a lung condition BK21/Carers review 2021/Draft versions/carersuk.org/help-and-advice/practical-support/when-caring-ends) has a list of practical things you may need to do.
