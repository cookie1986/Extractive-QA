[Find out more](#about)
## About this programme
This is a new online programme to support you to get better after having COVID. Healthcare professionals set up the Your COVID Recovery programme by working with people who had COVID, which helped them understand the effects of COVID on the body and mind.
This programme follows on from the [Your COVID Recovery website](https://www.yourcovidrecovery.nhs.uk/) launched in July 2020, which provides the latest advice on recovering from the virus. The original website is available to all and continues to be updated.
The programme contains a range of resources to help an individual cope with COVID. Some of these topics include: supporting your mental health, advice on getting moving again, information linked to symptom management and nutritional advice.
Individuals are encouraged to set goals and choose the resources that may help them to achieve their targets.
## How to access the programme
Your COVID Recovery is a password-protected web app available on your computer, tablet device or smart phone.
## Patients
Access is only available after a referral to the programme by a healthcare professional, who will provide you with a unique code for registration.
## Healthcare professionals
Please get in touch if you are a healthcare professional and are interested in providing this programme in your area.
The programme is free for services in England and we are planning on offering the Your COVID Recovery Programme to healthcare professionals outside of England.
However, there will be a cost for services outside England. Please contact us to find out more information.
