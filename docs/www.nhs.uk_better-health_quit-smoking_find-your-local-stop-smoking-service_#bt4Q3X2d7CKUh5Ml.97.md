Always contact the individual service before attending to check you are eligible for its help.
Some face-to-face services have reopened – others may provide sessions via phone or video call.
## What to expect at a local Stop Smoking Service
Developed by experts and ex-smokers – and delivered by professionals – local Stop Smoking Services provide free expert advice, support and encouragement to help you stop smoking for good.
The trained advisers are on hand to offer you support, either one to one or in a group, along with stop smoking medicines (prescription charges may be payable).
The sessions usually start a couple of weeks before you quit, and can be done via phone or video call if you cannot attend in person.   
Sessions are usually held once a week for 4 weeks after your last cigarette.
Evidence shows that people who manage to quit for 28 days are more likely to quit for good.
## How Stop Smoking Services can help you quit
Advisers are trained to deliver advice, support and encouragement that can improve your chances of quitting. 
They can tell you about nicotine replacement products and other stop smoking medicines, and can also recommend which product or combination of products could work for you.
They can support you if you want to use your own e-cigarette, also called a vape, to help you quit too.
Need a little extra motivation? Your adviser can measure the level of carbon monoxide in your body (the CO level) using a carbon monoxide monitor. The monitor shows how your CO level drops to the same level as a non-smoker's just 48 hours after your last cigarette.
