## What is the Clean Air Champions scheme?
The Clean Air Champions scheme is Asthma + Lung UK’s programme for students to become ambassadors for clean air. The scheme has 3 building blocks that students will take action on to become Clean Air Champions:
* **Raise awareness** - use the free educational resource pack to help your students raise awareness. This could be an assembly, a presentation in class, or designing some posters.
  
* **Campaign** - spread the word in your local community. You could reach out to your local MP to tell them about your activities.
  
* **Fundraise** - raise money to support those communities worst affected by air pollution. Empower your students to make a real difference both in their community and beyond.
**For your young change-makers, fighting for clean air is fighting for their future – both for their environment and for their health.**

## How does the site work?
This website is the hub for the Champions scheme. You can sign up for your school here and find the resource pack in your school profile dashboard.   
  
If you choose a sponsored walking challenge for your fundraising activity, your students can use this website to keep track of their walking distance and collect their donations. They can also join teams in their classes, see their progress on the leaderboards and unlock badges!   
  
Pupils can click on the 'Register' button on the top menu to begin signing up, with the help of a parent or guardian.   
  
Pupils organising a sponsored walk with their schools is a great way to show how switching car journeys for walking or active travel can have a positive effect on air quality. The students’ incredible fundraising is such an important step in making a difference in the fight for clean air. 
### Save paper on sponsorship forms and time collecting cash, use this website to collect your donations quickly and easily as part of your fundraising activity. Students can create their own pages or donate directly to their school here.
#### Raise Awareness
Champions use our free resource pack to build their knowledge of air pollution and then spread the word to their school and community. This could be talking to their class, presenting in assembly or making a display board – whatever they choose!
#### Campaign
Champions can use their voices to make a difference. This could be by writing a letter to their MP, signing a petition or spreading the word in their local community.
