## **1.****Introduction**
The Northern Ireland Assembly Commission (Assembly Commission) supports the work of the media, provides office space and facilitates access within Parliament Buildings and its immediate environs (Parliament Buildings). This Media Handbook (Handbook) sets out the parameters within which media personnel are facilitated within Parliament Buildings. The Handbook also sets out the requirement for all media personnel to adhere to a Code of Conduct while they are in Parliament Buildings.
### **Media personnel access**
Rules for media personnel accessing Parliament Buildings can be found in [Section 2 of this Handbook.](#Media_Passes)
### **General media enquiries**
The media’s primary contact in Parliament Buildings is the Assembly Commission’s Communications Office (Communications Office), located in Room B4. Media enquiries are dealt with between 9am and 5pm, Monday – Friday (excluding Public and Bank Holidays).  For information and support, telephone 028 9052 1405 / 5938 / 1606 or email [info@niassembly.gov.uk](mailto:info@niassembly.gov.uk) .
If you require a response (a line) on issues relating to the work of the Assembly, the Speaker, committees, plenary, the Assembly Commission etc. you will need to submit your request to the Communications Office using the email address [info@niassembly.gov.uk](mailto:info@niassembly.gov.uk) with the following information:
* A clear and detailed account of the request and any likely supplementary questions.
* Your contact details.
* The preferred timescale for answering the media/information request.
As some queries may be complex, making your request in writing ensures that the Communications Officer has the necessary information to respond appropriately.
**NB**: The Communications Office strives to respond to all queries within the timescales requested; where this is not possible, the Communications Office will provide an indicative time for the response.
If your enquiry is in relation to an Executive Department or Ministerial activity, please contact the Executive Information Service (EIS) via the relevant Departmental press office.
If your enquiry is in relation to a political party, please contact the party directly.
### **Media Interviews**
Interviews with committee chairpersons/deputy chairpersons, in respect of their committee responsibilities, should be arranged through the Communications Office.
In addition, interviews with the Speaker, Assembly Commission members, or Assembly Commission officials, in respect of their official responsibilities, should be arranged through the Communications Office.
To help facilitate the request, please supply the following:
* The purpose/context for the interview.
* The timescale for responding.
* Whether the request is for TV/radio/print/down the line/pre-recorded interview.
* Whether anyone else will be on at the same time as the Assembly interviewee.
* The proposed location (please note that during term time, interviews in Parliament Buildings will be easier to facilitate—particularly for filmed interviews).
* The proposed time of the interview.
**NB**: If you are contacting an MLA to speak in their individual, Party or political capacity, you will need to contact the appropriate party press officers directly.
Interviews with individual MLAs should be arranged and agreed with their parties. Please note that media personnel will need to be accompanied by the MLA or party support staff when accessing rooms/offices on the second, third and fourth floors.
Other than MLAs, interviews are allowed in the Great Hall with committee witnesses, members from other legislatures and anyone else who agrees to be interviewed. Official press conferences, where media personnel are invited to attend, can only be organised by the Speaker, Assembly committees, political parties, individual MLAs or by the Assembly Commission.
Apart from press conferences, if you are not a Media Passholder and are requesting permission to film or take photographs in Parliament Buildings or within its environs, you should contact the Communications Office for guidance and approval. You can view [the Filming and Photography Policy Procedure and the application](http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/news-and-media/information-for-journalists/filming-and-photography-policy/) at this link.
**NB**: Parliament Buildings may not be used as a backdrop for party political purposes, including interviews with elected Members or those standing for election. Parliament Buildings must not be used for election canvassing purposes at any time.
### **Shared workplace**
Parliament Buildings is a shared workplace. Media/media equipment must not impede access into or around the building. Common work areas like kitchens and photocopying rooms are for MLAs, party staff, and Assembly Commission staff only. Media personnel are allowed access to certain corridors (dependent on the type of pass held) but they must not film, photograph or record there without prior arrangement with the Communications Office, unless otherwise stated within this Handbook.
### **Accessing Offices**
MLA, party support staff and Assembly Commission staff offices are private. Media personnel must be accompanied by a member of Assembly Commission staff, an MLA or party staff member before entering any office. Media personnel may record/film within MLAs’ offices only with permission of the MLA and when accompanied by the MLA or Party staff.
### **Code of Conduct**
Parliament Buildings is a working environment. All media personnel should treat Assembly Commission staff, MLAs, their staff and visitors to Parliament Buildings with due courtesy and consideration and conduct themselves appropriately.
Media personnel are required to sign a ‘Code of Conduct’ form in which they will agree to adhere to the stated regulations within this Media Handbook. Alleged breaches of this code will be notified to the pass holder's employer or in the case of freelance personnel, to their sponsoring organisation and to the Assembly Commission’s Head of Communications.  The Head of Communications can enforce a penalty to withdraw media accreditation, whose decision will be final. All breaches will be recorded for monitoring purposes.
All media personnel must observe the requirements of this Handbook, agreed Assembly Commission regulations about areas that are out-of-bounds and other agreed conventions. Impromptu ‘door-stepping’ interviews on camera, on tape or in person are strictly prohibited. Media pass holders are also reminded that they must observe and respect the privacy of Assembly Commission staff and visitors to Parliament Buildings. Please note that Assembly Commission staff, include ushering staff, should not be filmed or photographed without their express permission.
Media personnel should not act as paid or unpaid lobbyists for any individual or organisation that might seek to influence the political process or benefit from inside knowledge of it and may not use their accredited status to do so.
Security requirements take precedence and arrangements may be redefined at any time to meet specific security needs. Media personnel must comply with any request or instruction communicated to them by Usher Services or a member of the Communications Team. Health and safety guidance must be observed at all times.
## **2.  Media Passes and General Information**
Members of the media who do not have a permanent media pass should present themselves to staff on the reception desk in the Great Hall. Proof of media accreditation must be presented at this time (current NUJ card, proof of employment with/or a letter of introduction from a recognised media outlet).
Those who do not have a pass must complete a Code of Conduct form at this time. Alternatively, applicants can complete, sign and email the form available in Section 10 of this handbook to info@niassembly.gov.uk in advance with evidence of media accreditation as outlined above. Please see Section 10 for further details.
Permanent media passes are provided to media personnel who attend Parliament Buildings on a regular basis and issue is at the discretion of the Communications Office.
Applications for a permanent media pass should be made through the Communications Office. Permanent media passes are valid for two years from the date of issue. The expiry date will be printed on the pass and when this date has been reached the pass will become invalid. You will then have to apply for a new pass. Permanent Media pass applicants will be expected to complete and sign a Code of Conduct form, please see Section 10 for further details.
Media passes must be worn and displayed at all times in Parliament Buildings.
All those holding a permanent Media pass (Regular, Intermediate or Correspondent) must swipe in when they enter Parliament Buildings and swipe out when they leave.
There are four categories of media pass:
### **1. Media DAY pass**
A temporary daily pass for those who attend Parliament Buildings occasionally or for specific events. These passes will be issued at the reception desk where a photograph will be taken for use on that day and future passes. In line with our personal data handling procedures, photographs will be deleted from the system after 90 days. Applicants wishing to obtain a Media Day Pass beyond that period will be required to have their photograph taken again. ([More information for Media Day Pass holders is available here](#info_day_regular_intermediate)).
### **2. Media REGULAR pass**
A permanent pass for those personnel who attend Parliament Buildings regularly. ([More information for Media Regular pass holders is available here](#info_day_regular_intermediate)).

### **Mobile Phones and Electronic Equipment**
The use of mobile/smart phones and electronic equipment is permitted within Committee Rooms as long as the equipment is utilising the Parliament Buildings wifi network and switches off the mobile signal which interferes with the broadcasting equipment. It is not permissible to record the proceedings or to take photographic stills or footage in the room without the express permission of the Committee. This permission must be sought before the meeting begins and should be coordinated through the Communications Office.
It is recommended that media personnel connect to the Assembly media wifi network as it has more functionality for media use, as opposed to the 'open' network. To access the 'media' wifi (NIA\_MEDIA), each individual device will need to be paired with the network which can be done by filling in an access form, available from the Communications Office.
