 Who can and cannot take or use ibuprofen
## Who can take ibuprofen
Most adults and young people aged 17 and over can take ibuprofen.
For under-17s, read our information on [ibuprofen for children](/medicines/ibuprofen-for-children-old/).
## Who may not be able to take ibuprofen
Do not take ibuprofen by mouth or apply it to your skin if you:
* have ever had an allergic reaction or symptoms like wheezing, runny nose or skin reactions after taking [aspirin](/medicines/aspirin-for-pain-relief/), ibuprofen or other [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)](/conditions/nsaids/) such as naproxen
* are pregnant
To make sure ibuprofen tablets, capsules, granules or liquid is safe for you, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you:
* have ever had bleeding in your stomach or a hole (perforation) in your stomach caused by an NSAID
* have had a hole (perforation) in your stomach, bleeding in your stomach or a [stomach ulcer](/conditions/stomach-ulcer/) more than once
* have a health problem that means you have an increased chance of bleeding
* have severe [heart failure](/conditions/heart-failure/), severe kidney failure or severe liver failure
