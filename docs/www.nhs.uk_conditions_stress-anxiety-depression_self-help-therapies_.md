 Self-help therapies
**Self-help therapies are psychological therapies that you can do in your own time to help with problems like stress, anxiety and depression.**
They can be a useful way to try out a therapy like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to see if it's for you.
They can also be convenient if:
* you're short of time
* you have family or work commitments
* you cannot get out easily
If you do not feel better after trying a self-help therapy, there are other things you can try, like a [type of talking therapy](/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/types-of-talking-therapies/).
A GP or local talking therapies service can tell you more.
## Guided self-help on the NHS
Guided self-help is where you work through a self-help workbook or computer course with the support of a therapist.
You can get some talking therapies, including guided self-help, on the NHS.
You can refer yourself directly to a talking therapies service without a referral from a GP.
[Find an NHS talking therapies service](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-psychological-therapies-service/)
If you prefer, you can talk to a GP and they can refer you and share relevant information about you.
If guided self-help is available from the talking therapies service you're referred to, and it's the right choice for you, the service will help you get started.
## Online tools for mental health
There are lots of online tools you can use to help improve your mental health. Some are available on the NHS.
Research shows that, for some people, online tools can be as effective as face-to-face therapy with a therapist for depression, anxiety and other mental health problems.
Some allow you to work through a self-help course online with support from a therapist.
Others offer live therapy with a therapist using instant messaging.
You can also join an anonymous online community where you can talk to other people who have similar mental health problems to you.
You do not need much experience with computers or technology to use them.

### Am I eligible for NHS online tools?
Whether you can get access to an online tool on the NHS depends on the problems you're experiencing and how severe they are.
It also depends on whether the NHS talking therapies service you're referred to offers online tools for mental health.
## Self-help books
Check whether a book was written by a counsellor or therapist who has lots of experience and is registered with a professional body, such as the British Psychological Society.
You should find this information in the front or back of the book.
Or look for self-help books that have been recommended by a professional organisation, such as the Royal College of Psychiatrists.
