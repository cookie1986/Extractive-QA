# Applying for healthcare cover abroad (GHIC and EHIC)
There are 2 types of cover available.
You can apply for either:
* a UK Global Health Insurance Card (UK GHIC)
* a UK European Health Insurance Card (UK EHIC), if you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement
[Find out more about the Withdrawal Agreement on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/withdrawal-agreement-explainer-for-part-2-citizens-rights)
For most people, the UK Global Health Insurance Card (UK GHIC) replaces the existing European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) for new applications.
[Apply for a new UK EHIC or UK GHIC](https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/cra/start)
A UK GHIC and new UK EHIC are free of charge. Beware of unofficial websites, they may charge you a fee to apply.
Before going abroad, make sure you [check the latest COVID-19 travel guidance on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-abroad-from-england-during-coronavirus-covid-19).
## 
 
 Important
There is no deadline to apply for a GHIC or EHIC. If you have an existing EHIC, you can continue to use it until it expires.
## If you have an existing EHIC
If you have an existing EHIC, it will remain valid until the expiry date on the card.
You can apply for a new card up to 6 months before your current card expires.
Information: 
It’s currently taking longer than usual to process new UK EHIC and GHIC applications due to high demand. We’re working to resolve this and will process all applications as soon as possible.
If you need emergency treatment while you’re visiting another country and haven’t received your card, you can apply for a Provisional Replacement Certificate (PRC).
## How to use your card
You can use your card to access medically necessary state-provided healthcare when you're visiting an EU country or Switzerland.
Medically necessary healthcare means healthcare that cannot reasonably wait until you come back to the UK. Whether treatment is necessary is decided by the healthcare provider in the country you're visiting.
Medically necessary healthcare includes things like:
* emergency treatment and visits to A&E
* treatment for a long-term or pre-existing medical condition
* routine medical care for pre-existing conditions that need monitoring
* routine maternity care, as long as you're not [going abroad to give birth](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/going-abroad-for-treatment/giving-birth-outside-the-uk/)
* oxygen therapy and kidney dialysis
You'll need to pre-arrange some treatments with the relevant healthcare provider in the country you're visiting – for example, kidney dialysis or chemotherapy.
[Check the Foreign Office country guides on GOV.UK for information on how to access treatment in the country you’re visiting](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/healthcare-in-the-eu-norway-iceland-liechtenstein-and-switzerland)
Not all state healthcare is free within the EU and Switzerland and so you may have to pay for services that you would get for free on the NHS.
Information: 
Your EHIC or GHIC is not a substitute for travel insurance. It may not cover all health costs and never covers repatriation costs. Make sure you have travel insurance as well as your card.
## If you're abroad and do not have your card with you
You can get a Provisional Replacement Certificate (PRC) to prove your entitlement to medically necessary healthcare if you travel to Europe without your existing EHIC, UK GHIC or new UK EHIC and need treatment during your visit.
If you need a PRC outside opening hours, you should call as soon as possible the next working day.
The PRC will give you the same cover as an existing EHIC, UK GHIC or new UK EHIC until you return home.
When calling for a PRC, you'll need to give:
* your National Insurance number
* your name
* your address
* your date of birth
* the name of the treatment facility
* the email address for the specific department of the organisation providing your treatment
To apply for a PRC [contact NHS Overseas Healthcare Services](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/contact-us/overseas-healthcare-services-contact-us).
Someone else can apply for a PRC on your behalf.

## Who cannot apply using this online service
Most people can apply using our online service.
You should [contact NHS Overseas Healthcare Services](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/contact-us/overseas-healthcare-services-contact-us) if you fall into one of the following groups as you will not be able to use the online service to apply.
### If you're an EU or Swiss national student
If you're an EU or Swiss national ordinarily resident in the UK, but studying in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, or Liechtenstein you may be entitled to a new UK EHIC or UK GHIC.
### If you hold a UK-issued A1
If you work in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, or Liechtenstein and have a UK-issued A1 document you may be entitled to a new UK EHIC or UK GHIC.
### If you're an au pair or nanny
If you're a UK or Irish national who usually lives in the UK permanently and you're going to work as an au pair or nanny in an EU country or Switzerland, you can apply for a UK GHIC.
### Chen and Ibrahim/Teixeira carers
If you're an adult carer of a child who is from the EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland, but you're not from any of these countries or from the UK or Ireland, you may be eligible to apply for a new UK EHIC for yourself and for any other children you have who are not nationals of these countries.
You cannot apply if your right to reside in the UK is derived from your caring for a British citizen (Zambrano carer).
### Dependent grandparents and grandchildren
You can add a grandchild to your new UK EHIC application if they’re a non-UK national, are a national of the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, or Liechtenstein and are one of the following:
* under 18, living in the UK and were born before 1 Jan 2021
* older than 18 but born on or after 1 January 2000, and arrived in the UK after 31 December 2020
* older than 18, born before 1 January 2000, arrived in the UK after 31 December 2020, and are dependent on you
You can add a parent or grandparent to your new UK EHIC application if they’re dependent on you or your partner. Their relationship with you must have begun before 1 Jan 2021, they must live with you and also:
* be a non-UK national,
* be a national of the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, or Liechtenstein
* they must have arrived in the UK after 31 December 2020
If they're a national of any other country, they can be added if they have settled or pre-settled status under the European Union Settlement Scheme (EUSS). If they do not have settled or pre-settled status, they can be added if their relationship with you began before 1 January 2021.
## Claiming a refund
Depending on the country you visit you may be expected to pay all or part of your bill upfront and then claim a refund afterwards.
Some countries ask patients to pay a contribution towards the cost of their care, such as for prescription costs. This is known as a co-payment or patient share.
You can claim back the difference between the total bill and the co-payment, but the actual co-payment is not refundable.
Keep all receipts and any paperwork. You or your insurance company may need them if you're applying for a refund.
## What to do if you believe your existing EHIC, UK GHIC or new UK EHIC has been wrongly rejected
If you believe that your UK GHIC, new UK EHIC or existing EHIC has been wrongly rejected by a hospital or other healthcare provider in the country you're visiting, you should try and resolve the issue with them.
Explain that the card entitles the holder to necessary healthcare. It may be useful to direct them to the [European Commission’s EHIC webpage](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=653&langId=en), which provides images of all valid UK-issued EHICs and the UK GHIC.
If you need more help, [contact NHS Overseas Healthcare Services](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/contact-us/overseas-healthcare-services-contact-us). They can give you advice on what to do.
## What to do if you think you've been incorrectly charged for medical treatment by an EU Member State or Switzerland
It's important that you keep documents relating to your treatment. The Overseas Healthcare Services at the NHSBSA may ask you for more information to check your eligibility and the cost of the treatment you had. This could include:
* receipts or invoices relating to treatment
* confirmation of payments made to healthcare institutions
* documents relating to insurance cover if your insurer paid for treatment
* discharge documents
They'll look at your claim to decide whether you were charged when you should have been covered. If they determine that your treatment should have been covered by the UK GHIC, new UK EHIC or existing EHIC, they’ll reimburse you or your insurer for the costs of treatment which are covered by your card. This may not include the full cost of treatment.
You can [contact NHS Overseas Healthcare Services](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/contact-us/overseas-healthcare-services-contact-us).
