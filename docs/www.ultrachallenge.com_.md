## It's Your ChallengeYour Way!
 
High quality endurance style events to take on at **your** pace, for a wide range of fitness levels, ages & experience. For teams & individuals, for a charity of **your** choice or just do it for yourself – and achieve something special. No obstacles or mud pools, just wonderful British scenery, full support all the way, lots of food & drink, camaraderie, and your spirit, determination & sense of adventure! With 14 events, 3 distance options, and a few 10 km ‘tasters’ – there’s an Ultra Challenge® for everyone!
 
Walk, Jog, or Run at Your Pace
**Your Challenge – Your Way**! **Most W****alk, but many ‘Jog’ so may run a bit – walk a bit, and see how it goes! At the front ‘Runners’ may be stepping up from a marathon distance, testing themselves against the clock, or out for ‘UTMB’ qualifying points.**
10 km, 25 km, 50 km or 100 km
**A ‘continuous’ 100km full Ultra Challenge is quite tough, but is absolutely achievable with good preparation, our support teams & rest stops stocked with plenty of food & drink.** **OR – there’s a 2 Day 100 km ‘Daylight’ option with half way camping as a great alternative. There’s also a fantastic range of testing single day 50km ‘Half’ challenges, scenic 25km ‘Quarter’ challenges, and even a few 10 km ‘Taster’ options. Young Persons Discounts are available *(subject to min. age rules / distance)***
Join as a Team or Individual
**It only takes 2 to make a Team – but the more the merrier! A Team of friends or family can motivate & support each other, whilst sharing an unforgettable adventure with a great reason to celebrate! Teams can do the same, or a mix of distances, and sign up with the same or a mix of funding options. Individuals will meet many new friends enroute – and our experienced Support Team looks after everyone!**
Self Fund or for Charity
**Many fundraise for a charity of their choice, and you’ll be amazed how much you can raise on a ‘tough’ challenge – as friends & family will recognise & support your courageous endeavours! The Series raises £7+ million / year for UK charities. Others just want a great challenge – SELF FUND their place – and achieve something very special by pushing themselves further!**
Deals & DISCOUNTS
**There’s best value** **‘MULTI DEALS’** **for 2 or more Self Fund events – with up to 30%+ OFF!**
**We want to encourage the ‘YOUNG’ to join – so there’s 1/3rd** **OFF Self Fund prices for those aged 18 or less** **(*subject to event distance rules – ie 18 for 100km / 16 for 50km / 14 for 25km).***
UTMB Points
**If you have ambitions of competing in the famous ‘Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc’ event – an Ultra Challenge® is perfect to clock up ‘qualifying points’. Full Challenges (~100 km) have 3 or 4 points available & Half Challenges (~50 km) from 1 – 3 points.**  
Corporate Teams
**Looking for a great event for your team without all the hassle or costs of organising it? These events are PERFECT! Your Team will be energised, exercised, bonding, and motivated on a fun, accessible, safe, high quality outdoors event. With optional hospitality packages available –  you can make an Ultra Challenge® your company’s special event in 2023 – maybe supporting your ‘charity of the year’.**

Virtual Ultra Challenges
**Alongside the ‘Real Challenges’ there are parallel ‘Virtual Versions’ of each 100km Ultra Challenge®, enabling friends, family, and anyone else to get involved – or to help you train & get in shape. A great way to boost your fundraising network if you’re supporting a charity – or to get more colleagues involved & active if you’re a company**

Challenge App
Download our Ultra Challenge® App once you’ve signed up – with guides, optional extras, and the latest updates; there’s also an ‘event specific’ app available prior to each Challenge – with the final details.  Our lively Facebook forum is great for advice & meeting fellow Challengers. If you’re fundraising, your charity sends a support pack & their contact details.
Training Guides & Events
Experienced Challengers help develop our training guides & videos, on – foot care, nutrition, hydration, & building distance up for all levels of experience. We also run a few optional training walks – and for runners, bookable sessions with an Ultra coach.
Travel & Camping
There are bookable coach transfers, shuttle busses, & parking options before & after your challenge to make travel planning easier.  Most Events offer camping packages at the ~50km Saturday ‘half way’ for the 2 day ‘Daylight’ 100 km challenge option (or for a ‘half’ challenge) and at the main start venue for Friday night before the event.
Signed Route & Tracking
Pink arrows, and glow-sticks at night, mark the route, and with Google route maps in the App – you won’t get lost on an Ultra Challenge®! Our chip timing scans you at rest stops, with your progress tracked, and can be shared online.  If you want ‘**real time tracking**‘ to share with family & friends – there’s our new **Geo Tracker** hire service.
Rest Stops / Food & Drink
Our rest stops are the BEST! Covered stops every ~12.5 km or so, and major ones each ~25 km – all with seating, clean toilets, medical services, & shuttle busses. There’s a range of snacks & drinks at **all** stops, with full meals at the ‘major’ ones and the finish, **all included** in your entry fee. Ultra Challenge rest stops will help you get to that finish line!
Medical, Welfare & Safety
Rest stops have expert medical teams, with – doctors, paramedics, first aiders, podiatrists, & massage. There’re emergency response teams, safety marshals & experienced ‘Trek Masters’ on the route – with a 24 hr Control Room monitoring all aspects of the event just a phone call away. 
Finish Line Celebration
An Ultra Challenge® finish line is a celebration, and quite emotional for many after a tough journey. You’ll get a big cheer, a quality medal, a glass of fizz to toast your success, a visit to the massage tent, and a finishers meal. Memories will be long lasting – maybe personal goals redefined – and a great sense of achievement that, once aches & pains subside, will leave you wanting another challenge!
