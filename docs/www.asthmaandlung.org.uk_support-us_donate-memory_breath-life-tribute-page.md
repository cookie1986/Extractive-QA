# Breath of Life tribute page
A Breath of Life tribute page serves as a perfect way to remember and celebrate the life of a loved one in a special online space. It is a place where family and friends can come together to share their memories and raise money to help transform lung health.
Once you have created a Breath of Life tribute page you can return to it as often as you like. You can choose your background and add photos, music and stories to reflect your loved one’s personality.
It is also easy to share your page via email and social media or maybe include it on the order of service at the funeral. This way everyone can be part of raising money in memory of your loved one.
## 
 Create a lasting tribute
Remember a loved one by setting up a personalised tribute page that friends and family can donate to.
[Create a tribute page](/support-us/donate-memory/breath-life-tribute-page/create-tribute-page "Create a tribute page") 
## Find an existing Breath of Life tribute page
To find an existing tribute page, search for the name of the person being remembered.
 
## Raising money through your Breath of Life tribute page
There are many ways to use your Breath of Life Tribute page to raise money in memory of your loved one. You and your family and friends can:
* add donations to the page
* collect donations in lieu of flowers
* set up direct debits
* organise fundraising events
* take on a challenge
All the money you raise will be displayed on your page so that everyone who has contributed can be proud of what you’ve achieved together.
