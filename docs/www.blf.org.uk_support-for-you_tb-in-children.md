# Tuberculosis (TB) in children
Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious bacterial infection. This page has information for parents and carers about what tuberculosis in children is, what the symptoms are, and how to prevent the spread of infection.

## What is tuberculosis (TB)?
Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious bacterial infection that usually affects the lungs. However, it can affect other parts of the body too. Other parts of the body tuberculosis may affect include the: 
* bones (such as the spine)
* brain
* lymph glands
* stomach.
### Types of TB
Some children get TB and have no symptoms, but the bacteria are still in the body. This is called **latent TB**. Your child cannot spread TB if it is latent. 
Other children might get TB and it makes them ill. This is called **active TB.** 
Latent TB can develop into active TB, especially if a child’s immune system is weakened or they’re young. 
## What causes TB?
TB is caused by breathing in TB bacteria, called **mycobacterium tuberculosis.** Usually, the immune system can fight off these bacteria, but sometimes the bacteria make people ill. 
Children usually catch TB from close contact with an infectious person who is coughing. 
> Tuberculosis is rare in the UK, so the risk of infection is low. There are some countries where it is more common, and the risk of infection is higher, such as Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, and South Africa.
> 
> 
> 
## Which children are at risk of TB?
Children most at risk of getting TB and getting ill (active TB) are: 
* children living in the same household as someone diagnosed with TB
* children who are less than five years old
* children with [HIV infection](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hiv-and-aids/)
* children with [severe malnutrition.](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/malnutrition/)
Children under five are more at risk because their immune systems are not fully developed. 
## What are the symptoms of TB in children?
Children with latent TB will have no symptoms. Symptoms of active TB in children may include: 
* a cough that does not get better after three weeks
* a fever (high temperature)
* weight loss or difficulty putting weight on
* night sweats.
Other symptoms may affect the parts of the body where the TB infection has spread. For example, a child with TB affecting the brain may have symptoms such as headaches or a stiff neck. 
## How is TB diagnosed?
It can be difficult to diagnose TB in children. This is because there are far less TB bacteria in children than in adults. It’s also harder for children to cough up mucus. That means it’s difficult to find the bacteria in a sample from the lungs or stomach. 
### Testing for TB in the lungs
If doctors think your child has TB in their lungs, they may be referred to a TB specialist for tests such as: 
* a chest X-ray
* a blood test
* a skin test
* collecting mucus samples from the lungs or stomach (this is not a painful test).
### Testing for TB outside the lungs
Sometimes, TB bacteria can spread to other parts of the body. If doctors think your child may have TB in another part of their body, tests may include: 
* a blood test
* scans in that part of the body
* taking samples of fluid from the body with a needle, and testing them for TB bacteria
* biopsy – a surgeon makes a small cut and removes some tissue under general anaesthetic (your child won’t be aware this is happening). The tissue is then tested for TB bacteria.
### Testing for latent TB
Doctors may test your child for latent TB if they have been in contact with someone who has TB. Latent TB isn’t usually infectious and doesn’t normally cause symptoms. But sometimes latent TB can become active. 
Tests for latent TB may include: 
* a skin test
* a blood test
* a chest X-ray.
## How is TB treated?
Your child will see specialist TB doctors and nurses for treatment. TB is treated with a combination of antibiotics that fight the bacteria. **TB is curable.** 
If your child has active TB, they will need to take antibiotics for at least six months. 
> It is very important to make sure your child takes the full course of antibiotics, even if they seem to get better. Stopping treatment early could mean there’s untreated TB bacteria left in the body. These bacteria can then become resistant to the antibiotics. 
> 
> 
> 
If your child has latent TB, they will still need antibiotics, but they may take a lower dose for a shorter time. 
## How can I prevent the spread of infection?
Children diagnosed with active TB are usually not infectious. However, they should stay away from school, nursery or any other activities until a health care professional says they are **definitely not** infectious. This is usually after two weeks of antibiotic treatment for TB. 
You can help your child to prevent the spread of infection by: 
* asking everyone to wash their hands regularly
* throwing away used tissues in a sealed plastic bag
* keeping the windows open at home, where possible.
> ### The BCG vaccination
> 
> 
> Newborn babies should be offered a one-off BCG vaccination to help their body fight TB if: 
> 
> 
> * they were born in an area where TB infection rates are high
> * one or more of their parents were born in a country where TB infection rates are high
> * someone in their family has had TB in the past five years.
> 
> Children under 15 who weren’t vaccinated as a baby may also be offered the one-off BCG vaccination. 
> 
> 
> 
Adults with active TB in the lungs can spread it easily. Children usually catch TB from an infectious adult. 
Let doctors know if someone in your household has been unwell for some time, especially if they are coughing and losing weight. They will need to have tests to diagnose TB.
