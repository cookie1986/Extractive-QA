 Report a free NHS COVID-19 rapid lateral flow test result
Use this service to report the result from a free NHS rapid lateral flow test.
You cannot use this service to report results from a test kit you’ve paid for.
Report your test result online:
* every time you do one, no matter what it is - positive, negative or void
* within 24 hours of getting the result - you cannot report a result after this
You can only report one result at a time.
To use this service, you need:
* a test from a box which is still in date
* the QR code or ID number printed on the NHS test strip
* a mobile phone number so you can get a text to confirm that the NHS has got your result
This service is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/cofnodi-canlyniad-covid19).
 [Start now](https://self-report.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/report-result) 
## Before you start
Check the expiry date on the box the test came in. If your test is out of date:
* do not report the result
* take a new test from a box that is still in date
* dispose of any tests that are out of date - recycle what you can
## Get help to report a test result
If you cannot use the online service, call 119 to report:
* a positive test result
* a void test result
You do not need to report a negative test result by phone unless you’ve been asked to do a test because you’re going into hospital.
Calls are free from mobiles and landlines. Lines are open:
* Monday to Friday (closed on bank holidays), 9am to 5pm
* Saturday, 9am to 1pm
119 provides support in 200 languages.
[SignVideo](https://signvideo.co.uk/nhs119/) is a free online British Sign Language (BSL) interpreter service for 119.
You can use the free [Be My Eyes app](https://www.bemyeyes.com/) to get help from trained NHS Test and Trace staff. Download the app, go to ‘Specialized Help’ and select ‘NHS Test & Trace’ in the ‘Personal Health’ category.
## If you have a problem with your test kit
If anything in your COVID-19 test kit was missing or damaged, or you were harmed using the test kit, [report the problem online](/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-test-kit-give-feedback-or-report-harm) or call 119.
Do not use the test kit if any part of it is missing or damaged.
