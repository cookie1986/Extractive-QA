## Can I get help with heating costs?
If you live with a lung condition, you’ll know how important it is to [stay warm in the winter](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/cold-weather). Here is the support available if you need help paying your bills: 
### Energy Bills Support Scheme
Between October 2022 and March 2023 all households in England, Scotland, and Wales will receive a £400 discount on their energy bills from the government.
You do not need to apply for this discount, it will automatically be applied if you’re eligible. You do not need to pay it back either.
The government have [more information about the Energy Bills Support Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/energy-bills-support-scheme-explainer).
### Energy Price Guarantee
The government has announced a cap on how much you can be charged per unit of gas and electricity. This means that an average household’s energy bill will be £2,500 a year until at least June 2023.
The Energy Price Guarantee limits the amount you can be charged per unit of gas or electricity, so your exact bill amount will still depend on how much energy you use.
This is in addition to the Energy Bills Support Scheme.
The government have [more information about the Energy Price Guarantee](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/energy-bills-support/energy-bills-support-factsheet-8-september-2022).
### What are warm hubs?
Warm hubs are heated areas that some local councils have set up in public buildings, like libraries and community centres. You can spend time in these areas for free to keep warm and meet other people in your local community.
Find [warm hubs near you](https://warmspaces.org/spaces).
Your local council can give you more information about Warm Hubs.
### Cold weather payments
Cold weather payments are only paid when the average temperature in your area falls to 0 degrees Celsius or below for a period of seven consecutive days between 1 November and 31 March.
These payments are usually made to people on the following benefits:
* Pension Credit
* Income Support
* Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance
* Income-related Employment and Support Allowance
* Universal Credit
* Support for Mortgage Interest
The scheme will run from 1 November 2022 to 31 March 2023. 
The government have [more information about cold weather payments](https://www.gov.uk/cold-weather-payment/eligibility).
### Warm Home Discount Scheme
The Warm Home Discount Scheme is run with electricity providers and gives a one-off discount on your winter electricity bill. If you qualify for the discount, you’ll get a letter in the autumn or winter.
There are two ways to qualify for the scheme. These are:
* as part of the ‘core group’, or
* as part of the ‘broader group’.
The money will not be paid directly to you. If you’re eligible, your electricity supplier will apply the discount to your bill by 31 March 2023.
You may be eligible for the core group scheme if:
* your energy supplier is part of the scheme
* your name or your partner’s name was on the bill
* you were getting the Guarantee Credit element of Pension Credit or you’re on a low income.
You might be able to claim as part of the broader group if you’re on a low income and meet your energy supplier’s criteria for the scheme.
You might be able to apply directly to your electricity supplier for help if you’re not part of the core group, but:
* you’re on a low income
* you get certain means-tested benefits
* your energy supplier is part of the scheme.
Your electricity supplier decides who can get the discount. Get in touch with your supplier to see if you’re eligible and how to apply.
The government has more information about [the Warm Home Discount Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/the-warm-home-discount-scheme).
### What is the Priority Services Register?
The Priority Services Register is a support service for people who may be more vulnerable. All energy suppliers offer it. You can contact your energy supplier to get on the register.
Find out who your energy supplier is.
You will be eligible for extra support from your energy supplier if you: 
* are 65 or older
* are disabled or have a long-term medical condition – this includes if you have medical equipment to run in your home, such as oxygen concentrators, CPAP machines, or nebulisers
* are recovering from an injury
* have a hearing or sight condition
* have a mental health condition
* are pregnant or have young children
* need help with communicating (for example, if your first language is not English).
Being on the Priority Services Register means: 
* you’ll be told about planned power cuts
* you’ll get priority support in an emergency. For example, your supplier may provide heating and cooking facilities if your power is cut off
* you can get help with taking meter readings
* you can ask for information in different formats, such as large print or braille.
You may also be eligible for free gas safety checks.
Ofgem have [more information about the Priority Services Register](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/information-consumers/energy-advice-households/getting-extra-help-priority-services-register).

## Can I get help buying food?
Eating a [healthy diet](/living-with/healthy-eating "Healthy eating and weight") is really important if you have a lung condition. There is help available if you’re struggling to pay for food. 
### Food banks
Food banks are community organisations that help you if you cannot afford food or essential items. Your [local council](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council) should be able to tell you about the different food banks working in your area. 
Many independent food banks are open to everybody in need and you do not need a referral to use their services. If your nearest food bank does ask for a referral, you can get one from a GP, social worker, or Citizens Advice. 
Find out [more about getting a referral to a food bank](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/using-a-food-bank/#:~:text=Getting%20a%20referral,about%20your%20income%20and%20needs). 
You will receive a food parcel at the food bank. You can also access additional support, like debt advice, mental health support and benefits guidance.   
### Food waste apps
There are some apps aimed at reducing food waste where you can get free or very cheap food. Everybody can use these apps, they are not based on how much money you have. 
On the [Too Good To Go](https://toogoodtogo.co.uk/en-gb/) app, you can pick up ‘magic bags’ from a range of local restaurants, cafes, and bakeries. They usually cost between £2 and £4 and are filled with leftover food that is still good to eat. 
You can also share groceries and household items with your neighbors on the app [Olio](https://olioex.com/). The app also has volunteers who collect food from supermarkets and cafes and give this out for free. 
### Government schemes
If you’re pregnant or caring for a child under four in England, Northern Ireland, and Wales, you might be able to join the [Healthy Start scheme](https://www.healthystart.nhs.uk/). This scheme gives parents money to buy milk, baby formula, vegetables, and vitamins. 
In Scotland, there’s a similar scheme called [Best Starts Foods Card](https://www.mygov.scot/using-your-best-start-foods-card) for children under 3.

## Local council
Your local council might help you pay for things like:
* your energy and water bills
* food
* essential items, like clothing.
This help is known as 'welfare assistance' or the ‘Household Support Fund’. Every council runs a different scheme. You should ask your local council what you are entitled to. 
You do not have to be getting benefits to get help from your local council. If you do get benefits, they should not be affected by any help you get from your local council.  
Find out [how to contact your local council](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council).  
## Council Tax Reduction

## Transport schemes
Your lung condition might affect how you travel. You could get help with the cost of transport. 
### Public transport discounts
If your lung condition makes it hard for you to get around, you can apply for discounts on public transport. You could get free travel on buses and a 30% discount on train tickets.
Citizens Advice has [more information on public transport discounts](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/sick-or-disabled-people-and-carers/help-for-disabled-travellers1/help-with-transport-costs/help-with-the-cost-of-transport-if-youre-disabled/).

Find out if [you are eligible for the HTCS](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/help-with-health-costs/healthcare-travel-costs-scheme-htcs/). 
## Charitable grants
Charitable grants are there to help and do not have to be paid back. You can normally get help from charitable grants even if you aren’t eligible for welfare benefits.
