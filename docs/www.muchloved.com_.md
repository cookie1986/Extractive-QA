## What is an online Tribute?
This is your own special memorial website in tribute to your loved one, where you can share memories, thoughts and stories with family and friends as well as light candles, add music, photos and videos.
You can collect fundraising donations for a special charity or project in their name, organise events, celebrate anniversaries – and much more.

## Dedication pages : A shared place to remember
We understand that some people may want a simpler way to remember a loved one than creating their own tribute. Our dedication pages are a special, shared place to remember loved ones and share memories and messages of support. 
You can also visit our [**So Much Left To Say**](https://somuchlefttosay.dedicationpage.org/) page created to support families and friends during the recent pandemic.
## In Loving Memory
