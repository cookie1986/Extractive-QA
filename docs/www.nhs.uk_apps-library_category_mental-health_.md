NHS Apps Library
# The NHS Apps Library has closed
If you are looking for NHS apps, you can find them here:
* [NHS App](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-app/)
* [NHS COVID-19 app](https://covid19.nhs.uk/)
There is also the [MHRA Yellow Card app](https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/) for reporting side effects to medicines.
## A new way of recommending apps
We have decided to close the NHS Apps Library and instead we will link to recommended apps throughout the NHS website.
We want to make our recommendations as helpful as possible to everyone who comes to the NHS website for advice and guidance.
The apps that we recommend will be selected by clinical policy teams within [NHS England and NHS Improvement.](https://www.england.nhs.uk/about/)
This means that they:
* meet the required technical and clinical safety standards
* are approved by experts in a particular area, such as mental health policy or children’s health policy
[Find out more about our technical and clinical safety criteria on the NHSX website](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/digital-technology-assessment-criteria-dtac/)
