 [What is pulmonary fibrosis?](/conditions/pulmonary-fibrosis/what-pulmonary-fibrosis)
 
 Pulmonary fibrosis is the end result of many different conditions that cause scar tissue to build up in your lungs and make breathing increasingly difficult.
* ![Asthma + Lung UK](/sites/default/files/styles/listing_image_mobile_x1/public/2023-01/aluk_0.png?h=ec041e41&itok=cRRgMdwz)
### 
 [What are the causes of pulmonary fibrosis?](/conditions/pulmonary-fibrosis/what-are-causes-pulmonary-fibrosis)
 
 On this page we explain the different possible causes for pulmonary fibrosis (the scarring of the lungs).

### 
 [What are the symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis?](/conditions/pulmonary-fibrosis/what-are-symptoms-pulmonary-fibrosis)
 
 The different types of pulmonary fibrosis have similar symptoms. You’ll have tests and speak to a specialist consultant to find out exactly which type you have.
* ![Asthma + Lung UK](/sites/default/files/styles/listing_image_mobile_x1/public/2023-01/aluk_0.png?h=ec041e41&itok=cRRgMdwz)
### 
 [How is pulmonary fibrosis diagnosed?](/conditions/pulmonary-fibrosis/how-pulmonary-fibrosis-diagnosed)
 
 Pulmonary fibrosis is diagnosed through a number of different tests and is a joint effort from specialist teams. On this page we explain the tests you might have if it’s thought you might have pulmonary fibrosis.
* ![Asthma + Lung UK](/sites/default/files/styles/listing_image_mobile_x1/public/2023-01/aluk_0.png?h=ec041e41&itok=cRRgMdwz)
### 
 [Treatment for pulmonary fibrosis](/conditions/pulmonary-fibrosis/treatment-pulmonary-fibrosis)
 
 Your treatment will depend on the cause of the fibrosis. Once lung scarring occurs in the lungs it cannot be reversed, so there is no cure for existing fibrosis, whatever the cause.
* ![Asthma + Lung UK](/sites/default/files/styles/listing_image_mobile_x1/public/2023-01/aluk_0.png?h=ec041e41&itok=cRRgMdwz)
