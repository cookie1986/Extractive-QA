Digital Legacy Conference](https://digitallegacyassociation.org/)
Our annual Digital Legacy Conference advocates best practice and allows experiences to be shared
## **We are the professional body for digital assets planning and digital legacy safeguarding**
The Digital Legacy Association is the only professional body dedicated to digital assets and digital legacy. Since launching at Hospice UK’s annual conference in 2015, our mission has been to help ensure that everyone’s end of life wishes are met both in the physical world and the digital realm. We do this by supporting the general public, advising governmental organisations, social networks charities and other organisations to better support the public with their digital assets and digital legacy. We run training courses, develop best practices, publish resources and organise the annual Digital Legacy Conference. The Digital Legacy Conference has taken place in New York, Berlin, in London and online.
The internet is the biggest and most “disruptive” force since the industrial revolution. As a result, society is spending an ever increasing amount of time online. This has led to a range of benefits, whilst changing the way in which society prepares for death, mourns and remembers the deceased into posterity.
## If someone you care about dies how important is it for you to be able to view their social media profile?

![Claire Henry – Chief Executive of the Dying Matters Coalition](https://digitallegacyassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Claire_Henry_Web.jpg)Ensuring people understand how to protect and pass on their digital legacy is an increasingly important issue, which is why we are delighted that the Digital Legacy Association has been launched. Talking more openly about dying, death and bereavement benefits us all, as does putting plans in place for when we are dying, and for after our death.
Claire Henry – Chief Executive of the Dying Matters Coalition
![Dr Ros Taylor MBE – National Director for Hospice Care, Hospice UK](https://digitallegacyassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/0BOehB-E-382x400.jpg)Social media has a key place in our lives now, and we are learning that it becomes even more crucial as people face the end of their lives. It helps patients stay connected and boosts self esteem. But patients and those special to them don’t know how to manage this personal vital resource after a death – memories, music, photos and messages are lost. We are delighted that the Digital Legacy Association is being launched at our annual Hospice UK Conference for over 700 staff working with families at the end of life.

![Ruth Sheridan – Director of Supportive Care, St Christopher’s Hospice](https://digitallegacyassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/management-ruth-sheridan-320x400.jpg)It is important for end of life professionals to have an understanding of the internet and social media within the context of end of life. The Digital Legacy Association have developed a day long training workshop specifically to educate, improve skill-sets and provide best-practice in areas relating to digital assets and digital legacy. The workshop was developed with the support of St Christopher’s Hospice and includes contributions from a range of professionals and patients. “In recent years, the ways people choose to remember deceased family members and friends has changed. Trips to the cemetery are replaced by online memorials and social media sites which can be updated regularly and accessed freely. Healthcare professionals need to engage with service users to discuss digital legacies. This, in turn builds confidence in discussing dying, death and bereavement. St Christopher’s are pleased to have supported the foundation of the Digital Legacy Association.”
Ruth Sheridan – Director of Supportive Care, St Christopher’s Hospice
