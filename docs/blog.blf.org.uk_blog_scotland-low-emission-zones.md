# Scotland’s Big Four Cities Set to Finally Implement Low Emission Zones

**Rolling out Low Emission Zones was a key policy call in Asthma UK Scotland’s manifesto, but disappointingly COVID has caused severe delays to their progress. Gareth Brown, our Policy and Public Affairs Officer in Scotland, explains why this summer, councils are finally taking action and how you can get involved.**
Scotland’s four largest cities finally have proposals to deliver Low Emissions Zones (LEZs) that will help to tackle poor air quality caused by transport. From summer 2021, residents and visitors to Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee will have to comply with vehicle emissions standards to enter the city centre.
Asthma UK Scotland has long been calling for Low Emission Zones, which were permitted by the Scottish Parliament through the enactment the Transport (Scotland) Act 2019. The coronavirus pandemic has delayed the implementation of LEZs but following consultations this summer they will be introduced next year in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. 
This is a welcome development, but we are also calling for each local authority to set out how it can go further in reducing air pollution and make the public aware of the zones and their benefits.
### **So why do we need Low Emission Zones?**
Air pollution levels in our cities are too high and can heavily impact the lung health of all, especially children, the elderly and the most vulnerable. We envisage a world in which everyone can breathe clean air with healthy lungs.
Tackling transport emissions is central to this goal as poor air quality can be linked to a number of lung conditions, including asthma, COPD and lung cancer. When people are exposed to high pollution levels, for example on a busy road or during a high pollution episode, they breathe in these toxic materials into their lungs. 
These toxins can exacerbate symptoms, including triggering an asthma attack or a COPD flare-up. People with asthma may notice that they need to use their reliever inhaler more than normal when pollution levels are high. Exposure to polluted air is also linked to premature death.
It is clear from this that we must do more to tackle unhealthy air.
### **Consultations are taking place: get involved!**
Consultations are taking place in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee to set out the final proposals. Although each LEZ will come into effect next summer, there will be a two-year grace period for drivers to avoid fines for drivers who enter the zones in non-compliant vehicles. The LEZ’s in the big four cities will operate 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year, unless exempted by the local authority for certain events and emergencies. 
Asthma UK Scotland is responding to each of the consultations and the first response has already been submitted to [Dundee](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0221/4446/files/AUK-BLF_Scotland_-_Dundee_LEZ_Consultation_Response.pdf?v=1630059394) and [Aberdeen](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0221/4446/files/AUK-BLF_Scotland_-_Aberdeen_LEZ_consultation_response.pdf?v=1630059394). Our consultation response has been shared on social media and we are asking supporters, residents and businesses in the areas to support our stance of LEZs.
We will also be sharing the responses with local politicians to emphasise to them the importance of Low Emissions Zones in each city. Dundee’s consultation closed on 09 August, followed by Aberdeen on 22 August. 
However, if you live in Glasgow and Edinburgh, you still have to time to respond to the consultation and have your say:
[Glasgow City Council (glasgowconsult.co.uk)](https://www.glasgowconsult.co.uk/KMS/dmart.aspx?strTab=PublicDMartCurrent&NoIP=1) - Closes 02 September
[Edinburgh’s Proposed Low Emission Zone - City of Edinburgh Council - Citizen Space](https://consultationhub.edinburgh.gov.uk/sfc/low-emission-zone/) – Closes 20 September 
### **What else needs to change**
Low Emissions Zones are not the only answer to tackle Scotland’s air pollution. We believe these cities are taking the first steps to improving their air quality, but they can go further. There must also be greater investment in active travel and more advances and uses of greener technologies. 
We hope Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee pave the road for other cities and towns in Scotland to take effective measures to tackle air pollution and bring in more Low Emission Zones across the country, for the benefit of all our lungs. And that this is only the start of Scotland’s journey to tackling air pollution.
