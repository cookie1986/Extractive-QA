Information on waiting times for local health boards and specialties in Scotland

 About waiting times
This site shows information on waiting times for planned (elective) care. It does not show information for emergency (unscheduled) care.
The statistics included relate to the wait you may experience to:
* attend a particular outpatient clinic for the first time (known as a new outpatient attendance)
* receive treatment under the Treatment Time Guarantee (TTG) as an inpatient or day case
Outpatient statistics only cover clinics led by a medical consultant. They do not cover clinics led by other professionals, including nurse-led clinics.
A small number of specialist treatments provided as an inpatient or day case are not covered by the TTG.
