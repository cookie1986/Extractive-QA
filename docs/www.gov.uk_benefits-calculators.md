 Benefits calculators
You can use an independent, free and anonymous benefits calculator to check what you could be entitled to. This will give you an estimate of:
* the benefits you could get
* how much your benefit payments could be
* how your benefits will be affected if you start work or increase your hours
* how your benefits will be affected if your circumstances change - for example, if you have a child or move in with your partner
This guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/cyfrifiannell-budd-daliadau).
## Calculators
For information on income-related benefits, contribution-based benefits, Universal Credit, tax credits, Council Tax Reduction and Carer’s Allowance use:
* [Turn2us benefits calculator](https://benefits-calculator.turn2us.org.uk/)
* [Policy in Practice better off calculator](https://www.betteroffcalculator.co.uk/login)
* [entitledto benefits calculator](https://www.entitledto.co.uk/?utm_source=BAdviser&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=GovUK)
You can also check with a [local benefits adviser](https://advicelocal.uk/find-an-adviser) to find out what you could be entitled to.
## What you’ll need
You’ll need accurate information about your:
* savings
* income, including your partner’s (from payslips, for example)
* existing benefits and pensions (including anyone living with you)
* outgoings (such as rent, mortgage, childcare payments)
* Council Tax bill
