# Airline index
You may encounter some problems with air travel when you have a lung disease. However most people with lung conditions are now able to safely enjoy the benefits of air travel if they plan what they will need in advance. We have produced a database to help you to plan your air travel.  
  
In this database, airlines are listed from A to Z. You will find the contact details and individual oxygen policies for passengers for each airline.   
  
Please note that this airline index was last updated in August 2019.

Aegean Airlines
### Aegean Airlines
 Aegean airlines do not provide oxygen on board their aircraft, but passengers are allowed to take their own oxygen on board. Passengers are allowed to transport and use POCs in the cabin, in compliance with their baggage allowance policy.
They ask that a Medical Information Form (MEDIF) is first completed by a treating physician, and that oxygen cylinders used are accompanied by the corresponding documentation certifying its suitability for use during the journey. Passengers must have oxygen bottle air type until 2L.
Aegean Airlines allows passengers to bring POCs which are restricted to specific models:
* AirSep “Lifestyle”
* AirSep “Freestyle”
* Delphi RS-00400 “Central Air”
* DeVilbiss “iGo”
* Inogen On
* Inogen One G2
* International Biophysics “Lifechoice”
* Invacare XPO2
* OxLife “Independence”
* Respironics “Evergo”
* Sequal “Eclipse”
Electronically powered POCs are not accepted.
Aegean airlines ask that passengers who require oxygen notify them through their call centre (+30 210 6261000) so that they can provide them with precise guidelines for the procedures to be followed. For more information on the procedure, passengers should contact the call centre or email contact@ageanair.com

Aer Lingus
### Aer Lingus
 Aer Lingus provides oxygen on board their aircraft at an additional cost of €150/£140/$180 USD/ $225 CAD per flight. Only one request can be accommodated per flight. The following exceptions apply:
* Oxygen is not supplied in the Business Class cabin of their transatlantic A330/332/B757 aircraft (aircraft frequently used for flights between Ireland and North America), but oxygen is available for the economy cabins in this aircraft.
* 757 aircrafts only accommodate 2l.
* No request for 4 litres continuously/intermittently will be accepted on flights between Dublin and San Francisco, Athens, Bucharest, Bourgas or any of the Canary Islands due to the duration of the flight and aircraft type.
Medical clearance is also required and you will need to contact Aer Lingus Special Assistance at least 48 hours before you intend to fly, either by telephone or their online [special assistance request form.](https://www.aerlingus.com/support/forms/special-assistance-form/) Medical clearance is required also for asthmatic guests who require oxygen or whose condition has deteriorated in the previous 48 hours.
Passengers cannot bring their own oxygen on board or as checked baggage. Aer Lingus permits the use of FAA-approved POCs. A list of POCs allowed can be found on their website under Special Assistance> Medical Conditions> Carriage of Medical Equipment. Aer Lingus does not provide any on-board power sources for assistive devices so passengers are responsible for providing batteries with enough life to support their trip. Guided by FAA battery requirements an assistive device user must have 150% of their actual flight time in battery time at all time.

### Air France
Oxygen Therapy provided by Air France
Air France can provide therapeutic oxygen on board - this service is available for a fee and must be requested during booking, no less than 48 hours before your departure. In most cases, passengers are offered a kit (Wenoll WS120) that has been specially designed for air travel. This system functions “on demand” (rather than providing “continuous” oxygen). The system is extremely compact, with 600 litres of oxygen, enabling passengers to travel safely on long-haul flights. As long as your oxygen needs do not surpass 2,8 liters per minute, you will not need any kind of medical certificate to use this equipment. Otherwise, you may be offered an alternative solution, if it exists. You will be asked for a medical certificate.
This service may not be available when departing from certain airports or on certain flights, passengers can find out if this is the case during booking.
Use of respiratory devices
Air France allows the use of POCs. These devices can be used throughout the entire flight, however, the aircrafts cannot always provide you with a power source. Therefore, Air France recommend that you verify your device's ability to power itself and come prepared with additional batteries.The number of lithium batteries authorized on board is limited; please seek more information during booking. They ask that they are notified at least 48 hours before departure of a passanger's need for use of respiratory devices. The following POCs are authorised for use of Air France aircrafts:
* AirSep FreeStyle
* AirSep LifeStyle

Power Supplies  
Seats in Air France's La Première/First, Business and Premium Economy long-haul aircraft (Airbus A330-A340-A380 and Boeing 747 and 777) are equipped with power outlets that enable you to plug in approved respiratory devices. However, Air France aircrafts do not have all types of power outlets needed to plug in respiratory devices on board. Power outlets are disabled before and during takeoff and landing. They can also be disabled at any time by the crew if necessary. If you wish to plug in an approved respiratory device, please check that its total wattage does not exceed 75W. Attempting to use a device whose wattage exceeds 75W will automatically disable the power outlet. Please bring batteries with you to maintain power even during periods when power outlets have been disabled. Please note: Air France aircraft do not have all types of power outlets needed to plug in respiratory devices on board. Please contact customer service before your departure for specific information. The power outlets available on our aircraft can be used to power any connected electronic device, but they cannot recharge these devices. 
Personal Oxygen Tanks
Air France allows the transport, but not the use of, personal oxygen tanks meeting the following requirements:
* the height does not exceed 65 cm / 26 in maximum,
* the weight is less than or equal to 5 kg / 11 lb,
* they are equipped with a safety system that protects against the accidental discharge of their content.
Please give at least 48 hours notice if you plan on transporting a persnal oxygen tank.
