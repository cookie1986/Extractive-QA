# Books for and about grieving children
Reading books about death can help a child understand what's happened better and realise they’re not alone. We’ve included a short reading list below. Some of these books are intended for adults, and offer guidance on ways to support a grieving child.
If you’re a child who’s recently lost someone close to you, please get in touch with one of the charities listed at the bottom of this page.

## Books for children
**When someone has a very serious illness: children can learn to cope with loss and change** (1991) by Marge Heegaard (Woodland Press)

**Gentle Willow: A Story for Children about Dying** (2003) by Joyce C. Mills (Magination Press)
Written for children who may not survive their illness or for the children who know them, this tale helps address feelings of disbelief, anger, and sadness, along with love and compassion. Amanda and Little Tree discover that their friend Gentle Willow isn't feeling very well.
**Michael Rosen’s Sad Book** (2011) by Michael Rosen and Quentin Blake (Walker Books)
This chronicles Michael's grief at the death of his son Eddie from meningitis at the age of 19. A moving combination of sincerity and simplicity, it acknowledges that sadness is not always avoidable or reasonable and explains complicated feelings in simple terms.
