## Vaccinations for adults
All UK adults should have been offered two doses of the coronavirus vaccine.
Adults with a severely weakened immune system, are also eligible for a [third primary dose](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/how-to-get-a-coronavirus-vaccine/how-to-get-an-additional-primary-dose-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine/) of the vaccine.  
 
## 
 Changes to COVID-19 vaccine booster doses
You can no longer get a vaccine booster dose. Some people who are at increased risk, for example because of age or certain medical conditions, may be offered a seasonal booster later this year. If you are eligible for this, the NHS will contact you when it’s your turn to get vaccinated. 
The NHS has more information about [booking your vaccines](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/). 
## Vaccinations for children and young people
Everyone aged 5 (on or before 31 August 2022) and over can get two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.
Children who turned 5 on or after 1 September 2022 can get the vaccine if they’re :
* at higher risk due to a health condition or because of a weakened immune system, or
* living with someone who has a weakened immune system.
## 
 Changes to COVID-19 vaccine booster doses
You can no longer get a vaccine booster dose. Some people who are at increased risk may be offered a seasonal booster later this year. If you are eligible for this, the NHS will contact you when it’s your turn to get vaccinated. 
You can book your child’s vaccine appointments on the NHS website.
## If you’re immunosuppressed
If you’re immunosuppressed, it means your immune system isn’t working properly and you may be more at risk of infections, like coronavirus. This includes people who:
* are on chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or have been in the last six months
* are on immunotherapy drugs
* have had a lung transplant
* were on high dose corticosteroids (20mg or more of prednisolone per day) for more than 10 days in the month before vaccination
* were on high dose steroids (more than 40mg prednisolone per day for more than a week) for any reason in the month before vaccination
* were on long term moderate dose corticosteroids (10mg or more of prednisolone per day for more than four weeks) in the three months before vaccination.
If you are or were severely immunosuppressed at the time of your first or second dose, you’ll be offered a third primary dose of the vaccine.  Your specialist will tell you if you should have a third primary dose.   
 
## How safe are the vaccines?
COVID-19 vaccines are safe for people with lung conditions. As with any new vaccine, we know people sometimes worry about safety. The COVID-19 vaccines given on the NHS have all met strict safety and quality standards. 
### If you’re taking warfarin
If you are on a blood thinner caller [warfarin](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/warfarin/) (used to treat pulmonary embolism) you should already be having regular blood tests to monitor the thickness of your blood.
On the day of your vaccine appointment, make sure you know your latest reading and when you were last checked.  This is to make sure it’s safe for you to have the vaccine.
If you don’t know your reading, ask your GP surgery before you go for your vaccination. If you don’t know your reading, you may not be able to get your vaccine on the day.   
 
### If you’re being treated with biologics
If you have asthma and are treated with biologics (known as mAbs, or monoclonal antibodies), it’s safe for you to get a covid vaccine but talk to your specialist about the best time to get it.  
If possible, you shouldn’t have your vaccine and your asthma biologic on the same day. This is so your clinician can identify any side-effects more easily.  
 
## 
 Make sure you keep taking your usual medicines
It is very important to keep taking your usual medicines, and not to change any doses without speaking to your specialist first. 
## Vaccine side effects
Most side effects are mild and shouldn’t last longer than a week. These include:
* sore arm where the needle went in
* feeling tired
* headache
* feeling achy.
If you need to, these can be treated with paracetamol.
Most people with allergies can have the COVID-19 vaccine. Serious allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines are very rare. Before your vaccination, let healthcare staff know if you’ve ever had a serious allergic reaction.
Serious side effects from the coronavirus vaccines are very rare.   
 
## 
 Call NHS 111 immediately
Call NHS 111 immediately if you get any of these symptoms up to four weeks after being vaccinated:
* a severe headache that doesn’t get better with painkillers
* a headache that feels worse when you lie down or bend over
* a headache with blurred vision, feeling or being sick, problems speaking, weakness, drowsiness or fits
* a rash that looks like small bruises or bleeding under the skin
* you feel out of breath or have chest pain, leg swelling or tummy pain.
### Blood clots and the vaccine
Blood clots are an extremely rare side effect, and the benefits of vaccination continue to outweigh any risks.
### What is in the coronavirus vaccine?
The COVID-19 vaccines do not contain egg or animal products.  You can find out the ingredients in the vaccines:
[Pfizer/BioNTech](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/information-for-uk-recipients-on-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine)  
[AstraZeneca/Oxford](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca/information-for-uk-recipients-on-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca)  
[Moderna](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna/information-for-uk-recipients-on-covid-19-vaccine-moderna)  
[Janssen (Johnson & Johnson)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-janssen/patient-information-leaflet-for-covid-19-vaccine-janssen)
If you have had a severe allergic reaction to any of the vaccine ingredients, or experience [anaphylaxis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/anaphylaxis/) after the first dose, you should not have the same vaccine for your second dose.  For advice specific to you and your condition, speak to your GP or a healthcare professional who knows your medical history.  
 
## How effective are the vaccines?
The COVID-19 vaccines are the best way to protect yourself and others from coronavirus. The vaccines have been shown to:
* reduce your risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from COVID-19
* reduce your risk of getting or spreading COVID-19
* protect you against different variants of COVID-19.
Protection from the virus can take three to four weeks after your first dose of the vaccine. You will need at least two doses of the vaccine, plus a booster dose, for protection that lasts longer.   
 
### Can I have the vaccine if I’ve had COVID-19?
If you’ve had a positive test or symptoms of COVID-19, you should wait four weeks from your first symptoms or your positive test (whichever is first) before you get a vaccine.
