## Cost of Living Payments 2023 to 2024
The government has announced [further Cost of Living Payments](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cost-of-living-payments-2023-to-2024) between spring 2023 and spring 2024. These payments are:
* £301 for people on an eligible low income benefit, to be paid during spring 2023
* £150 for people on an eligible disability benefit, to be paid during summer 2023
* £300 for people on an eligible low income benefit, to be paid during autumn 2023
* £300 for pensioner households, to be paid during winter 2023 to 2024
* £299 for people on an eligible low income benefit, to be paid in spring 2024
Most people should have received their 2022 Cost of Living Payment.
If you were eligible, you’ll be paid automatically in the same way you usually get your benefit or tax credits. This includes if you’re found to be eligible for a Cost of Living Payment or a Disability Cost of Living Payment at a later date.
If you have had a message asking you to apply or contact someone about the payment, [this might be a scam](https://www.gov.uk/report-suspicious-emails-websites-phishing).
You could get up to 3 different types of payment depending on your circumstances on a particular date or during a particular period:
* a Cost of Living Payment, if you were getting a qualifying low income benefit or tax credits
* a Disability Cost of Living Payment, if you were getting a qualifying disability benefit
* a Pensioner Cost of Living Payment, if you’re entitled to a Winter Fuel Payment for winter 2022 to 2023
These payments are not taxable and will not affect the benefits or tax credits you get.
## Low income benefits and tax credits
You may get a payment of £650 paid in 2 lump sums of £326 and £324 if you were getting payments of any of the following:
* Universal Credit
* income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA)
* income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)
* Income Support
* Pension Credit
* Child Tax Credit
* Working Tax Credit
The payment will be made separately from your benefit.
You will not get a payment if you were getting New Style Employment and Support Allowance, contributory Employment and Support Allowance, or New Style Jobseeker’s Allowance, unless you were getting Universal Credit as well.
If you had a joint claim with a partner, you will get one payment of £326 and one payment of £324 for your joint claim, if you’re entitled.
### Universal Credit
You were eligible for the first Cost of Living Payment of £326 if you were entitled to a payment (or later found to be entitled to a payment) of Universal Credit for an assessment period that ended in the period 26 April 2022 to 25 May 2022.
You were eligible for the second Cost of Living Payment of £324 if you were entitled to a payment (or later found to be entitled to a payment) of Universal Credit for an assessment period that ended in the period 26 August 2022 to 25 September 2022.
The payment will be made separately from your benefit.
#### Universal Credit ‘nil awards’
You will not be eligible for the Cost of Living Payment if your Universal Credit is reduced to £0 for the qualifying assessment period. This is sometimes called a ‘nil award’. Reasons your Universal Credit may be reduced to £0 for an assessment period include getting more than one payment of earnings, your or your partner’s earnings go up, your or your partner’s savings go up, you start getting another benefit.
If money has also been taken off for other reasons (such as payments of rent to your landlord or for money that you owe), you might still be eligible.
### Income-based JSA, income-based ESA, Income Support and Pension Credit
You were eligible for the first Cost of Living Payment of £326 if you were entitled to a payment (or later found to be entitled to a payment) of income-based JSA, income-related ESA, Income Support or Pension Credit for any day in the period 26 April 2022 to 25 May 2022.
You were eligible for the second Cost of Living Payment of £324 if you were entitled to a payment (or later found to be entitled to a payment) of income-based JSA, income-related ESA, Income Support or Pension Credit for any day in the period 26 August 2022 to 25 September 2022.
The payment will be made separately from your benefit.
### Tax credits
You were eligible for the first Cost of Living Payment of £326 if you received, or later receive, for any day in the period 26 April 2022 to 25 May 2022 either:
* a payment of tax credits for the tax year 2022 to 2023
* an annual award of at least £26 of tax credits for the tax year 2022 to 2023
You were eligible for the second Cost of Living Payment of £324 if you received, or later receive, for any day in the period 26 August 2022 to 25 September 2022 either:
* a payment of tax credits for the tax year 2022 to 2023
* an annual award of at least £26 of tax credits for the tax year 2022 to 2023
If you were getting both Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit, you will receive a Cost of Living Payment for Child Tax Credit only, which will be paid by HMRC.
If you were getting tax credits from HMRC and a low income benefit from DWP, you will get a Cost of Living Payment from DWP only.
### 2022 payment dates for low income benefits and tax credits
| Benefit or tax credits | Cost of Living Payment | When you’ll be paid |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Universal Credit | £326 | Between 14 and 31 July 2022 for most people |
|  | £324 | Between 8 and 23 November 2022 for most people |
| Income-based JSA | £326 | Between 14 and 31 July 2022 for most people |
|  | £324 | Between 8 and 23 November 2022 for most people |
| Income-related ESA | £326 | Between 14 and 31 July 2022 for most people |
|  | £324 | Between 8 and 23 November 2022 for most people |
| Income Support | £326 | Between 14 and 31 July 2022 for most people |

| Tax Credits | £326 | Between 2 and 7 September 2022 for most people |
|  | £324 | Between 23 and 30 November 2022 for most people |
If you had a joint claim between 26 April and 25 May 2022, a single payment of £326 will be sent using the same payment method used between these dates, if you’re eligible.
If you had a joint claim between 26 August and 25 September 2022, a single payment of £324 will be sent using the same payment method used between these dates, if you’re eligible.
Your payment might come later, for example if you are awarded a qualifying benefit at a later date or you change the account your benefit or tax credits are paid into. You will still be paid the Cost of Living Payment automatically and do not need to contact DWP or HMRC.
If you have received a Cost of Living Payment, but we later find that you were not eligible for it, you may have to pay it back.
DWP and HMRC are using a computer program to identify those eligible to receive a Cost of Living Payment. If you are not content with this you can contact the office that pays your benefit or tax credits to discuss it.
## Disability Cost of Living Payment
You may get a lump sum payment of £150 if you were getting any of the following:
* Attendance Allowance
* Constant Attendance Allowance
* Disability Living Allowance for adults
* Disability Living Allowance for children
* Personal Independence Payment
* Adult Disability Payment (in Scotland)
* Child Disability Payment (in Scotland)
* Armed Forces Independence Payment
* War Pension Mobility Supplement
### Eligibility
You must have received a payment (or later receive a payment) of one of these qualifying benefits for 25 May 2022 to get the payment.
If you were getting a qualifying disability benefit from the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and a qualifying disability benefit from DWP, you will get a Disability Cost of Living Payment from DWP only.
If you receive a Disability Cost of Living Payment, but we later find that you were not eligible for it, you may have to pay it back.
### 2022 payment dates for the Disability Cost of Living Payment
Most people were paid the £150 Disability Cost of Living Payment between 20 September 2022 and the beginning of October 2022.
Payments will be made to people who were getting a qualifying disability from DWP before payments to people who were getting a qualifying benefit from the Ministry of Defence.
