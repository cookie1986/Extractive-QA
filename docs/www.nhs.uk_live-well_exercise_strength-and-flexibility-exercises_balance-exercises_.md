 Balance exercises
**These simple balance exercises can be done at home to help improve your health and mobility.**
Do not worry if you have not done much exercise for a while, these balance exercises are gentle and easy to follow. 
Wear loose, comfortable clothing and keep some water handy. Build up slowly and aim to gradually increase the repetitions of each exercise over time.
Consider doing the exercises near a wall or a stable chair just in case you lose your balance.
Try to do these exercises at least twice a week and combine them with the other routines in this series:

This involves walking sideways by crossing one foot over the other.
**A.** Start by crossing your right foot over your left.
**B.** Bring your left foot to join it.
Attempt 5 cross-steps on each side. If necessary, put your fingers against a wall for stability. The smaller the step, the more you work on your balance.
## Heel-to-toe walk

**A.** Standing upright, place your right heel on the floor directly in front of your left toe.
**B.** Then do the same with your left heel. Make sure you keep looking forward at all times. If necessary, put your fingers against a wall for stability.
Try to perform at least 5 steps. As you progress, move away from the wall.

**B.** Lift your left leg, keep your hips level and keep a slight bend in the opposite leg. Gently place your foot back on the floor.
Hold the lift for 5 to 10 seconds and perform 3 on each side.
## Step-up

Use a step, preferably with a railing or near a wall, to use as support.
**A.** Step up with your right leg.
**B.** Bring your left leg up to join it.
**C.** Step down again and return to the start position.
The key for building balance is to step up and down slowly and in a controlled manner. Perform up to 5 steps with each leg.
