# How to organise a raffle
Whether you’re organising a charity ball or a bake sale, raffles are a fantastic way to boost your fundraising total! We’ve put together a few of our top tips to help you get organised and source some fabulous prizes.
## Our top tips for holding a fantastic raffle
* Include your top raffle prize on your poster to help sell lots of tickets
* When selling tickets you’re acting as an ambassador for Asthma + Lung UK, so remember to be friendly to everyone you chat to
## Keeping it legal
Due to the laws surrounding raffles there are a few simple guidelines you need to meet:
* All tickets must be sold on the same day that the raffle is drawn
* Don’t spend more than £500 on prizes – this doesn’t apply to any donated prizes
* Don’t spend more than £100 on the cost of the raffle
* You can’t roll over any prizes you advertised for your raffle to another one
* All tickets must be sold for the same price
* If your plans don’t fit these guidelines, [contact us](mailto:community@asthmaandlung.org.uk?subject=I%20have%20a%20question). It may be that you need to apply for a lottery license from your local council
## How to source some amazing prizes!
* Where possible, try to get your prizes donated, so your hard earned fundraising all goes to the fight against lung disease
* Get in touch and ask us for an authorisation letter. You can use this to show businesses who you’re fundraising for, and ask for some great donations
* Think carefully about who is coming to your event and what type of prizes they’d like to win
* Start local and ask in person – it’s much harder to say no face to face!
* Ask, Ask, Ask – the worse that can happen is you’ll hear “no”
* Ask your friends and family to ask their networks for prize donations too – the more people asking the more success you’ll have
* Make sure you’ve got a few Asthma + Lung UK facts ready to go, just in case anyone asks about why you’ve chosen to support us
> ### Some quick facts about us
> 
> 
> When you’re selling raffle tickets you’re likely to be asked about us, so it’s often helpful to have a few facts up your sleeve.
