Please complete this form and we’ll refer you to our partners at the National Free Wills Network. They’ll send you a free will writing pack in the post in the next week or two.
In your pack will be a list of local solicitors and a declaration form to take with you to claim your free will. All you need to do is choose a solicitor and book an appointment. **Your will is paid for by Asthma + Lung UK at no cost to you.**
There is no obligation to leave a gift in your will to Asthma + Lung UK when you use our free will writing service. However, after providing for your loved ones, please consider helping us achieve our vision of a world where everyone breathes with healthy lungs with a gift in your will to us.
