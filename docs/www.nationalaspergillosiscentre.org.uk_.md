 National Aspergillosis Centre
 Aspergillosis is the name of a group of conditions caused by a mould called Aspergillus. This family of moulds usually affects the respiratory system (windpipe, sinuses and lungs), but can spread to anywhere in the body in those that are immunocompromised.

 The National Aspergillosis Centre provides expertise for the diagnosis and management of infections caused by the fungus Aspergillus
## The National Aspergillosis Centre at MFT
The UK National Aspergillosis Centre (NAC) is based at our renowned North West Lung Centre, Wythenshawe Hospital. It is part of the [Infectious Diseases](https://mft.nhs.uk/wythenshawe/services/infectious-diseases/) service and provides expert fungal infection management.
In 2009 NAC was commissioned by the Department of Health to provide long-term care for patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA). We are a national leader in developing expertise in the clinical management of CPA with sophisticated diagnostic testing and monitoring for patients with this condition. Developing research, knowledge, and expertise in this area support the advancements in high-quality clinical care required to contribute to the care of patients with CPA and all other forms of aspergillosis.
The centre was formerly led by Professor David Denning, who retired from clinical medicine in September 2020. In January 2021, [NAC appointed Caroline Baxter as its new Clinical Director](https://mft.nhs.uk/2021/01/15/new-clinical-director-appointed-at-the-national-aspergillosis-centre-nac-wythenshawe-hospital/).
