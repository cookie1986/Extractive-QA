# How your company can get involved
## Charity of the year
Make it a year to remember by choosing Asthma + Lung UK as your company’s charity of the year. We’ll work with you to put together an exciting programme of fundraising tailored to you, including fundraising events, volunteering and engagement opportunities for your staff to get involved with.
Please nominate Asthma + Lung UK for your company’s Charity of the Year – [get in touch](mailto:corporate@auk-blf.org.uk) with us if you need any support for your nomination.
## Cause related marketing
Most customers are more likely to buy a product or service associated with a cause they know and care about. Associate your brand with Asthma + Lung UK through a cause related marketing partnership to connect with new and existing audiences, leverage customer support through your campaigns and add emotive storytelling to your products. We’ve got plenty of experience working on these partnerships - take a look at our [partnership with NiQuitin](https://www.blf.org.uk/take-action/lets-work-together/our-partners/partnership-with-niquitin) to find out what we’ve done in the past.
## Events and employee fundraising
We have an exciting catalogue of events to suit all of your employees, from cycle rides and runs, to our dress in blue fundraising event, [Blues’Day](https://www.blf.org.uk/bluesday), and our new [36K Clean Air Challenge.](https://www.blf.org.uk/36k-clean-air-challenge) Whether you want to hold a bake sale in the office or take on a challenge, fundraising is a fantastic way to get your staff engaged, build solid teams and encourage leadership skills. The money you raise will continue our fight for everyone affected by lung disease.
## Sponsorship
Sponsor an event, a campaign, our award-winning health information leaflets or our research. You’ll increase your visibility to your target audience while demonstrating your values.
## Strategic partnerships
As part of a strategic partnership we’ll work with you to develop a bespoke partnership plan which links our life-saving work with your company’s long-term strategic objectives, unlocking shared value and impact for both Asthma + Lung UK and your organisation.
## Gifts in kind
Donations don’t always need to be in cash. We’d love to receive raffle prizes or professional services and expertise from your company.
