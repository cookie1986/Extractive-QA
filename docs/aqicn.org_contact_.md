   # About the World Air Quality Index projectaqicn.org - waqi.info
     ![](/images/logo/regular.png) The *World Air Quality Index* project is a non-profit project started in 2007. Its mission is to promote air pollution awareness for citizens and provide a unified and world-wide air quality information.   
   
 The project is providing transparent air quality information for more than 130 countries, covering more than 30,000 stations in 2000 major cities, via those two websites: [aqicn.org](https://aqicn.org) and [waqi.info](https://waqi.info).  The founding team, located in Beijing China, is composed of several contributors in the domain environmental sciences, system engineering, data science, as well as visual design. The team has been expanding worldwide, with new key supporters from Singapore, India, Australia, USA.   
   
 The project, despite its social intent and expensive outreach, has never received any public funding. The limited income, essentially from online ads, is used to cover the infrastructure and hardware cost. Engineering work is contributed.      
 The project is constantly looking for support from more contributors. It has now received active contributions from more than 15991 citizens from 137 countries:

 # Credits
   
  All the credits must go to the US Embassies in China for initially providing and publishing their PM2.5 air quality measurement, to the China MEP for the huge effort in providing PM2.5 for so many cities, and all the worldwide Environment Protection Agencies for their excellent work on monitoring and providing Air Quality information .  
   
 All this work is made possible thanks to the excellent work for the [worldwide EPA](/sources/) (below list not exhaustive):

   [![](/images/sources/worldmap-2019.03.jpg "world air quality monitoring stations coverage by the World Air Quality Index project")](/sources/)    # Common question & answers
 1. Air Quality Data sources: All the Air Quality data seen on World Air Quality Index are the official data from each country respective Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Data from each EPAs is measured using professional monitoring equipment. The full EPA source list used in World Air Quality Index is available from [sources](/sources/) page. - Seeing different readings from other websites: This is most likely normal, and due to the fact that different websites use different AQI scales present the data. At World Air Quality Index, we are using the US EPA scale, while other website might use different scales. Check this [article](/faq/2015-03-20/a-comparison-of-worldwide-air-quality-scales-part-1/) for more information. - I want to monitor the air quality in my area: As high-end professional stations can be really expensive (more than $10K per stations), the World Air Quality Index project / Earth Sensing Labs has designed specialy optimized and affordable monitoring stations costing as low as $200. Please check the [GAIA](/products/gaia/) air quality monitoring station product page. - I want to add a new station on the map: Provided your monitoring station is qualified (for instance if it is using BAM, TOEM or GAIA technology), then adding a new station on the map is not only simple and straightforward but also completely free. Please refer to this [page](/publishingdata/) for the full explanation - Data quality & real-time validation: The data published on World Air Quality Index is real-time and therefore unvalidated at the time of publication. In order to strengthen the quality, a set of real-time AI algorithms are used to detect abnormal data conditions (sparks, low reporting, etc.) and automatically 'disable' data reported from defective stations. - Historical data access: We are currently investigating with several international institutions (WHO, UN, GEO) the possibility to setup a framework for accessing the historical Air Quality data. If you are from an international institution, organization or university and want to join this effort, then check our [data platform](/data-platform/register/) page. - API (Application Programing interface): The World Air Quality Index project is offering a free API for maps, tiles and programatic JSON access. Check the [API](/api/) page for more information. - Contributing to the World Air Quality Index project: The project is always looking for more hands to support the activities: For instance, to write articles, to improve our applications, to create new data visualization, to improve the air quality forecast or to translate the website and app to news languages. Check the [contribute](/contribute/) page for more info. - Fundings: The World Air Quality Index project is independent from any governement and any "profit" corporation. It has so far not received any fundings from any public nor private entity. The limited income from online ads is used to cover infrastructure cost. - Why chosing the U.S. EPA index to harmonize the data? This is mostly for historcal reason: When we started in 2007, there was not so many alternative, and the US EPA was actually quite proactive at promoting the idea of clean air, so the choice was natural. Some alternatives, such as the European “Common Air Quality Index” could also have been a good option, but the EEA failed to promote their standard. This won't be a problem for long anyways, since we are now working on a improvement which will allow users to select any scale they want among a list of more than 80 scales! - How many cities do you currently provide air quality data for and is the info available on your app in each of them? We are providing the data for 9000 stations worldwide ~ that’s around 600 major cities in 70 countries. The info is available in the app for each of them, but not all of the cities have the “full” set of pollutant monitoring (e.g. PM2.5, PM10, Ozone, NO2, SO2, CO). For example, some only have PM10 or a composite AQI. We are also continuously increasing the coverage, targeting to get 10 to 20% more stations every year. The full list of cities and stations is available from [this page](/city/all/). - Media kit? Our public media kit is available from the [media kit](/media/) page.

  # Air Quality Rankings
 # About the Air Quality and Pollution Measurement:
  About the Air Quality Levels  
   
  
| AQI | Air Pollution Level | Health Implications | Cautionary Statement (for PM2.5) |
| 0 - 50 | Good | Air quality is considered satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk | None |
| 51 -100 | Moderate | Air quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people who are unusually sensitive to air pollution. | Active children and adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should limit prolonged outdoor exertion. |
| 101-150 | Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups | Members of sensitive groups may experience health effects. The general public is not likely to be affected. | Active children and adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should limit prolonged outdoor exertion. |
| 151-200 | Unhealthy | Everyone may begin to experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects | Active children and adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should avoid prolonged outdoor exertion; everyone else, especially children, should limit prolonged outdoor exertion |
| 201-300 | Very Unhealthy | Health warnings of emergency conditions. The entire population is more likely to be affected. | Active children and adults, and people with respiratory disease, such as asthma, should avoid all outdoor exertion; everyone else, especially children, should limit outdoor exertion. |
| 300+ | Hazardous | Health alert: everyone may experience more serious health effects | Everyone should avoid all outdoor exertion |
