You will need a referral to use Trussell Trust food banks. 
[Free food and food banks](/advice-and-support/food-no-money-food-banks/)
[Free school meals (GOV.UK)](https://www.gov.uk/apply-free-school-meals)
## Moving around the supermarket
Some supermarkets have: 
* wheelchairs
* mobility scooters
All supermarkets should have trolleys that you can use with a wheelchair. 
Contact your supermarket to find out.
[Find your local ShopMobility centre](https://www.shopmobilityuk.org)
## Quiet or relaxed shopping hours

[Sunflower lanyard (Hidden Disabilities)](https://hiddendisabilitiesstore.com/catalog/category/view/s/sunflower-lanyards/id/22/)
## Finding volunteers
You can find volunteers to shop with you or for you by contacting: 
* [your local authority (GOV.UK)](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council)
* a local charity or organisation for your condition or impairment
* [your local Age UK](https://www.ageuk.org.uk/services/in-your-area/shopping/)
* [your local Covid-19 Mutual Aid UK group (Covid Mutual Aid)](https://covidmutualaid.org/local-groups/)
You could also try to find support through local Facebook groups.
[Find your local time bank (Timebanking UK)](https://timebanking.org/find-your-nearest-time-bank/)
### Before they shop for you
When asking a volunteer to shop for you, talk about: 
* how to pay
* where to leave your shopping
* writing a shopping list together and how much it should cost
* food allergies
* if you’re happy with substitute products
* giving you a receipt afterwards
### Prescriptions
Some pharmacies offer free prescription delivery services. Some volunteers will collect prescriptions and medication for you. Ask a family member or friend if you do not feel comfortable with this. 
## Warning Keep your card and details safe
Do not give your bank card or card details to a volunteer. Use a more secure way of paying such as cash, cheque or a bank transfer.
## Paying a volunteer
### Cash
Pay a volunteer in cash after they drop off your shopping. Try to have the exact amount. You could give this to them or put it in an envelope somewhere safe for them to collect. 
### No cash?
Payout enables you to give someone you trust a unique barcode and let them get cash for you from a Post Office branch or bank. You do not need a Post Office Account. This is available to all banks, building societies and credit unions.
[Payout (Post Office)](https://www.postoffice.co.uk/post-office-payout) 
### Bank transfer
If you cannot take cash out, transfer the amount directly to the volunteer’s bank account after they drop off your shopping. You can do this online or through your banking app using their sort code and account number.
### PayPal
PayPal allows you to pay someone online without swapping bank details. Use the volunteer’s email address or phone number to pay. Or they can give you a [PayPal Me link](https://www.paypal.me/) for the amount. 
Sign up with your bank details or the following cards:
* Visa, Visa Delta or Visa Electron
* Mastercard or Eurocard
* Maestro
* American Express
[Sign up to PayPal for free (PayPal)](https://www.paypal.com/uk/home)
### Paying by phone
Some voluntary organisations are using a password system so that people can pay for shopping by phone. 
To do this, you need to give your volunteer a password or number. When they finish shopping, they can go to the customer service desk and call you. The service desk staff will confirm that your passwords or numbers match, and then take the payment from you over the phone.
### Gift cards
Some supermarkets have gift cards: 
* [Asda gift cards](https://www.asdagiftcards.com/volunteer-shopping)
* [Sainsbury's gift cards](https://sainsburysgiftcard.co.uk/)
* [Morrisons gift cards](https://my.morrisons.com/blog/community/morrisons-gift-cards/)
* [Waitrose gift cards](https://johnlewisgiftcard.com/JohnLewisWaitrose/ByEmail/JohnLewisWaitrose/ChooseProduct?productGroup=Waitrose)
* [Tesco gift cards](https://www.tescogiftcards.com/)
You can buy gift cards online for a volunteer to use. Most shops will allow you to check the balance of the gift card online.
### Bank volunteer cards
Some banks provide a second bank card you can give to a volunteer. These include:
* a [connected card from Starling Bank](https://www.starlingbank.com/features/connected-shopping-card/) where you can set money aside for a volunteer to use
* [carer cards from NatWest, RBS and Ulster Bank](https://www.rbs.com/rbs/news/2020/04/natwest--royal-bank-of-scotland-and-ulster-bank-launch-card-for-.html) which you can top up with £100 every 5 days
Contact your bank to see if they have similar cards.
### Cheques
Some volunteers may accept cheques.
