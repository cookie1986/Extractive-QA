The Department is committed to providing the highest standard of service to all its customers. Our aim is to get things right first time.”
## How do I make a complaint against the Department of Health
The **DoH** Complaints Procedure is designed to address any specific concerns our customers have that relate to the quality of customer service provided by DoH staff..
For example this might include:
* maladministration

* difficulty in contacting the correct office, branch or person
* incorrect information or guidance issued by the Department
* attitude and conduct of DoH staff
The procedures set out below explains how you can make a complaint about the quality of our services. Please note that there are separate complaints procedures in place for any dealings with health and social care organisations outlined below.
**Informal Procedure**
Our aim is to resolve any complaint quickly and you are invited initially to bring any matter of concern to the attention of the Departmental official with whom you have been dealing. However, if you still feel dissatisfied after this approach, you may initiate a formal complaint in writing.
**Formal Procedures – Step 1**
All formal complaints should be in writing.  Please provide as much information as possible along with contact details, such as your name, telephone number and postal address.  We will handle any personal data you provide in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.
You can write to us at the following address:

Or email us at [complaints@health-ni.gov.uk](mailto:complaints@health-ni.gov.uk)
In all cases the Department will:
* acknowledge receipt of your complaint.  We will normally issue a letter of acknowledgement within two working days of receiving your complaint
* treat your complaint in a confidential manner
* refer your complaint to the relevant Director
* carry out a thorough investigation
* aim to provide a written reply to your complaint with a full explanation of the outcome of our investigations within 20 working days and, where this is not possible, let you know when a reply can be expected
* apologise if we have made a mistake or if a problem has been caused by us

## Making a complaint about top management in the department
If you are a member of the public or an external stakeholder and your complaint is about a staff member in top management of the department, there is a different procedure for making a complaint.
Top Management in the NI Civil Service and its agencies means the Head of the Civil Service, Permanent Secretaries and anyone in a Grade 3/Deputy Secretary position (or equivalent level). 
## Northern Ireland Public Services Ombudsman
Our complaints procedure is not a substitute for your right to complain to the Northern Ireland Public Services Ombudsman's Office.
You should note, however, that the Northern Ireland Public Services Ombudsman will generally expect you to have used all the steps of the Department’s internal Complaints Procedure before accepting your complaint.
Details of the Northern Ireland Public Services Ombudsman's procedures can be found on the [NIPSO Website](https://nipso.org.uk/nipso/).

## Raising a concern (HSC Whistleblowing Framework and Model Policy)
All of us at one time or another may have concerns about what is happening at work. HSC organisations wants you to feel able to raise your concerns about any issue troubling you with your managers at any time. They expect their managers to listen to those concerns, take them seriously and take action to resolve the concern, either through providing information which gives assurance or taking action to resolve the concern.
HSC organisations recognise that many issues are raised by staff and addressed immediately by line managers – this is very much encouraged.
[The HSC Whistleblowing Framework and Model Policy](https://www.health-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/health/hsc-whistleblowing.PDF) is aimed at those issues and concerns which are not resolved, require help to get resolved or are about serious underlying concerns. It applies to all staff (employees, workers) involved in the work of an HSC organisation and has been adopted by all HSC organisations.
