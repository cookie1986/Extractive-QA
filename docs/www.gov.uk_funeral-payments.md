 Get help with funeral costs (Funeral Expenses Payment)

# 
 How it works
You could get a Funeral Expenses Payment (also called a Funeral Payment) [if you get certain benefits](/funeral-payments/eligibility) and need help to pay for a funeral you’re arranging.
This guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/taliadau-angladd).
## If you live in Scotland
You can [apply for a Funeral Support Payment](https://www.mygov.scot/funeral-support-payment/). It has replaced Funeral Expenses Payment in Scotland.
## If you receive money from the deceased’s estate
Your Funeral Expenses Payment will be deducted from any money you get from the deceased’s estate.
The estate includes any money or property they had but not a house or personal things left to a widow, widower or surviving civil partner.
## What you’ll get
Funeral Expenses Payment can help pay for some of the costs of the following:
* burial fees for a particular plot
* cremation fees, including the cost of the doctor’s certificate
* travel to arrange or go to the funeral
* the cost of moving the body within the UK, if it’s being moved more than 50 miles
* death certificates or other documents
You can also get up to £1,000 for any other funeral expenses, such as funeral director’s fees, flowers or the coffin.
The payment will not usually cover all of the costs of the funeral.
How much you get depends on your circumstances. This includes any other money that’s available to cover the costs, for example from an insurance policy or the deceased person’s estate.
[Check the claim form notes](/government/publications/funeral-payment-claim-form) for full details of what Funeral Expenses Payment covers.
If the deceased had a pre-paid funeral plan, you can only get up to £120 to help pay for items not covered by their plan.
## How the money is paid
Funeral Expenses Payment is [paid into your bank, building society or credit union account](/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid) if you’ve already paid for the funeral.
The money will be paid directly to the organiser of the funeral (for example, the funeral director) if you have not paid yet.

[What to do when someone dies: step by step](/when-someone-dies)
1. ### 
Step 1:
 Register the death
 
	1. [Register the death within 5 days](/after-a-death?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
Check what to do if: 
	* [the death has been reported to a coroner](/after-a-death/when-a-death-is-reported-to-a-coroner?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	* [the death happened outside the UK](/after-a-death/death-abroad?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	* [you're registering a stillbirth](/register-stillbirth?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	* [someone is missing and you think they're dead](/get-declaration-presumed-death?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
To stop or change benefits payments you can tell the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) about the death straight away.
2. ### 
Step 2:
 Arrange the funeral
 
	1. [Arrange the funeral](/after-a-death/arrange-the-funeral?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	2. [Find bereavement services from your local council](/find-bereavement-services-from-council?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	3. [You are currently viewing: Get help paying for a funeral](#content)
	4. [Get help paying for a child's funeral](/child-funeral-costs?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	5. [Find bereavement help and support](/after-a-death/bereavement-help-and-support?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
3. ### 
Step 3:
 Tell government about the death
 
The Tell Us Once service allows you to inform all the relevant government departments when someone dies.
	1. [Use the Tell Us Once service to tell government](/after-a-death/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	2. [If you cannot use Tell Us Once, tell government yourself](/after-a-death/tax-benefits-vehicles?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
You'll also need to tell banks, utility companies, and landlords or housing associations yourself.
4. ### 
Step 4:
 Check if you can get bereavement benefits
 
You might be eligible for financial help. 
Check if you can get:
	* [Bereavement Support Payment if your partner has died](/bereavement-support-payment?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	* [Guardian's Allowance if you're bringing up a child whose parents have died](/guardians-allowance?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
5. ### 
 and
 
 Deal with your own benefits, pension and taxes
 
Your tax, benefit claims and pension might change depending on your relationship with the person who died.
	1. [Manage your tax, pensions and benefits if your partner has died](/death-spouse-benefits-tax-pension?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	2. [Check how benefits are affected if a child dies](/after-a-death/if-a-child-or-baby-dies?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
6. ### 
 and
 
 Check if you need to apply to stay in the UK
 
If your right to live in the UK depends on your relationship with someone who died you might need to apply for a new visa.
Check the rules if:
	* [you're in the UK as the partner of a British Citizen or someone with indefinite leave to remain](/visas-partner-dies?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	* [your partner who died served as a member of HM Forces](/government/publications/hm-forces-partners-and-children?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	1. [Contact UKVI to check the rules for other visas](https://www.gov.uk/contact-ukvi-inside-outside-uk)
7. ### 
Step 5:
 Value the estate and check if you need to pay Inheritance Tax
 
To find out if there’s Inheritance Tax to pay, you need to estimate the value of the property, money and possessions (the ‘estate’) of the person who died.
	1. [Estimate the value of the estate to find out if you need to pay Inheritance Tax](/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	1. [Find out how to report the value of the estate](/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died/check-type-of-estate?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	1. [Pay Inheritance Tax if it’s due](/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died/inheritance-tax-to-pay?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
8. ### 
Step 6:
 Apply for probate
 
You might need to apply for probate before you can deal with the property, money and possessions (the ‘estate’) of the person who died.
	1. [Check if you need to apply for probate](/applying-for-probate?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	1. [Apply for probate](/applying-for-probate/apply-for-probate?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
9. ### 
Step 7:
 Deal with the estate
 
Pay any debts or taxes owed by the person who's died. You can then distribute the estate as set out in the will or the law. 
	1. [Deal with the estate](/probate-estate?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	1. [Update property records](/update-property-records-someone-dies?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
