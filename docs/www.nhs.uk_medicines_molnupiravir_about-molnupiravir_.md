 About molnupiravir
Molnupiravir is an antiviral medicine that works by stopping the virus that causes coronavirus (COVID-19) from growing and spreading.
It's used to treat early COVID-19 infection and help to prevent more severe symptoms.
Molnupiravir is only available on prescription. However, you will only be eligible to have the medicine if you're in the [highest risk group](/medicines/molnupiravir/who-can-and-cannot-take-molnupiravir/).
If you are in the highest risk group, you may be sent a letter and a lateral flow test that you can do at home should you develop symptoms of COVID-19. You must [report your COVID-19 lateral flow test result on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result).
If you are eligible, have tested positive for COVID-19 and have reported the result, you will be contacted by the NHS. This will usually be by text, email or phone.
If you have not been contacted within 24 hours of your positive test, but you think that you may be eligible for COVID-19 treatments, call your GP surgery, specialist or 111. They will be able to make an urgent referral if needed.
You will then be given an assessment to see if molnupiravir is right for you. If it's suitable they’ll tell you how you will get the medicine. It may be sent to you at home, or a hospital pharmacy may arrange for the medicine to be delivered to you. It can also be collected by someone else such as a friend, relative or NHS volunteer responder.
Molnupiravir comes as capsules. You'll need to start taking the capsules as soon as possible after you have tested positive for COVID-19 and within 5 days of your symptoms starting.
If you are eligible for COVID-19 treatment you will usually be offered [Paxlovid](/medicines/paxlovid/) or [remdesivir](/medicines/remdesivir-veklury/), before molnupiravir.
