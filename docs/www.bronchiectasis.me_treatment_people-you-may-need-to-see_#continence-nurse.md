# People you may need to see
## Hospital consultant and team
If your GP suspects you may have bronchiectasis, you will be referred to a hospital doctor who specialises in this condition. You will attend an outpatient clinic appointment where you will see either the consultant or one of their team.
## GP
* Some people see their GP quite frequently and others have little contact with them.
* Once you have a diagnosis of bronchiectasis you may find that you see the hospital team more than your GP.
* You will still need to see your GP at times and also to ensure that you get the medication that you need.
* It is important that you communicate with your GP. It is particularly important that they know about the type of [antibiotics](/treatment/treatments#antibiotics "Antibiotics") that you need and how long you need them for. If you play an active role then you can make sure that everyone knows what you need.
## Physiotherapist
* Physiotherapy is extremely important to make sure that you can [clear the sputum or phlegm from your lungs.](/treatment/treatments/#mucus-phlegm-clearance "Sputum (phlegm) clearance")
* You will see a physiotherapist who specialises in how to do this.
* Physiotherapists can also help you with maintaining fitness, [managing breathlessness,](/treatment/managing-breathlessness/ "Managing breathlessness") pulmonary rehabilitation and [cough incontinence.](/learn/what-symptoms-might-i-get#cough "Cough")
* You may also find this link helpful <http://bronchiectasis.com.au/physiotherapy>
## Specialist nurse
* Often the hospital will have a nurse who specialises in lung diseases and bronchiectasis.
* You may see them when you go to clinic or if you are ever admitted to the hospital ward.
* In some hospitals the specialist nurse may be able to offer advice over the phone about your treatment or any problems you are having. They may also offer a service for people who need to take [antibiotics into the vein](/treatment/treatments/antibiotics-into-veins-intravenousiv/ "Antibiotics into veins (intravenous/IV)") but prefer to do this at home rather than in hospital.
## Lung function technician
* When you are referred to the hospital you will have some breathing tests done.
* These are often done by a lung function technician or physiologist.
* These tests may be done in the clinic or you may go to a separate department to have them done.
## Dietician
* Often people with bronchiectasis can be helped by having advice from a dietician.
* This may be general healthy [diet and lifestyle](/help-advice/diet-exercise-and-lifestyle-advice/ "Diet, exercise and lifestyle advice") advice or specific advice tailored to your needs.
* Sometimes people with bronchiectasis struggle to keep their weight up and a dietician can advise you.
## Continence nurse
* Having a chronic cough can cause some people to experience [bladder leakage or cough incontinence.](/learn/what-symptoms-might-i-get#cough "Cough")
* This is something that is important to tell your doctor about so that they can refer you to a nurse who specialises in helping with this.
