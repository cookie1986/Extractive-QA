About Gift Aid:
I am a UK taxpayer and I would like the Asthma and lung UK to reclaim the tax on all qualifying donations I have made, as well as any future donations, until I notify them otherwise. I understand that if I pay less income / capital gains tax than the amount of gift aid claimed on all my donations in the tax year in which they are received, it is my responsibility to pay any difference.
If you need any help with your direct debit, please contact our Supporter Care Team on 0300 222 5800 or [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)
If you need to speak to someone about a lung condition, please contact our helpline on 0300 222 5800.
