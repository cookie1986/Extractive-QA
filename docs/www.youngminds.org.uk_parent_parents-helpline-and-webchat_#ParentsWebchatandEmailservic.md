## Parents Helpline
Call our Parents Helpline for detailed advice, emotional support and signposting about a child or young person up to the age of 25.
**You can call our Parents Helpline on 0808 802 5544, Monday - Friday 9:30am - 4:00pm.**
Alternatively, you can contact us via our [webchat](/parent/parents-helpline-and-webchat/#ParentsWebchatandEmailservice "Parents Helpline and Webchat") by clicking the chat icon in the bottom right corner of your screen.
* Our Parents Helpline is available in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
* You’ll get through to a trained adviser who will listen and talk through your concerns in complete confidence.
* Your adviser will help you to understand your child’s behaviour and give you practical advice on what to do next.
* If you need further help, they’ll arrange for one of our independent, experienced professionals to call you for a 50-minute telephone consultation within seven days.
* Please note, calls may be recorded for monitoring or training purposes.
* Hard of hearing or speech-impaired? Please use Typetalk or Textdirect to contact us, or use our Parents Webchat.
* If English is not your first language, we can arrange for an interpreter as a member of LanguageLine.
## Please note we're unable to:
* provide assessments, counselling/therapy or direct support to young people
* process referrals to CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service), statutory or local services
* provide families with ongoing support, since we are a one-off service
* offer support to professionals, friends or wider family members who are not the child’s main carer
* offer advice around medications prescribed to young people
We aim to support parent/carers with their child's mental health in the best way we can.
## Parents Webchat and Email service
Our parents webchat and email service provides information and signposting to help parents and carers find the information they are looking for with regards to their child's mental health.
### 
Webchat
![A square speech bubble which has upside quotation marks for eyes and smile underneath.](/media/tj5p0tkt/kustomer-webchat-without-text.png?quality=55)
**Our Parents webchat is open 9:30am - 4pm, Monday - Friday.**
When you launch a webchat you will be asked a few short questions by our chat assistant to help us understand the concerns you have for your child. Once you have completed these questions, we will place you into a queue and try to connect you with the next available adviser as soon as possible.
Once you are connected, a webchat adviser will direct you to information on our website or signpost you to other organisations that can offer further support. The conversation will last around ten minutes. Following your chat you will have the option to receive a copy of your conversation by email.
### 
Email
**You can email the team outside of webchat hours between 4pm - 9:30am Monday to Friday, or over the weekend.**
*Please be aware that our parents@youngminds.org.uk email address is no longer active, and you will not receive a response from our team if you send an email to this address - please use the chat icon to submit an email instead.*
We would kindly ask that anyone who emails our service to expect a tailored response within 3-5 working days.

## Please note we're unable to:
* provide specific clinical advice around managing your child's symptoms and behaviour, or a diagnosis
* be a listening or counselling service
* give guidance around specific local support services, as we are a national service
* provide a crisis service
* offer advice around medications prescribed to young people
## Using our Parents Helpline services
## Friendly and confidential
* We know it’s difficult to call the first time – but don’t worry. Your conversation with us will remain confidential unless we suspect that a child, young person or vulnerable adult may be experiencing, or is at risk of experiencing harm.
* Rest assured, if we need to share any information with anyone outside of YoungMinds, we will inform you first, unless there is immediate risk to life that requires very quick action. More information about our safeguarding policy can be found [here](/about-us/our-policies/safeguarding-policy/ "Safeguarding policy").
* We will keep a record of your call on a secure and confidential database and this will help if you need to call us again.
* For more information about how we use and store your data read our [privacy policy](/about-us/our-policies/privacy-policy/ "Privacy policy").
## Accessibility and languages
* **Hard of hearing or speech impaired?**
Please use Typetalk or Textdirect to contact us on the Parents Helpline, or use our Parents Webchat.
