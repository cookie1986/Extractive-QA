### Keep an eye on your vitamin D
To keep bones and muscles healthy, everyone should consider taking a daily vitamin D supplement in autumn and winter, when we cannot make enough vitamin D from sunlight.
And some people should take them all year round, including children up to the age of 4 and people who are at risk of not getting enough vitamin D.
Just 10 micrograms a day is all you need – it's the same for kids and grown-ups.
