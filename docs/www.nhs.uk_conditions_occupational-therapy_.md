# Occupational therapy
**Occupational therapy aims to improve your ability to do everyday tasks if you're having difficulties.**
## How to get occupational therapy
You can get occupational therapy free through the NHS or social services, depending on your situation.
You can:
* speak to a GP about a referral
* [search for your local council](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council) to ask if you can get occupational therapy
You can also pay for it yourself. The Royal College of Occupational Therapists lists qualified and registered occupational therapists.
[Find an occupational therapist](https://rcotss-ip.org.uk/find)
You can check an occupational therapist is qualified and registered with the Health & Care Professions Council (HCPC) using its [online register of health and care professionals](http://www.hcpc-uk.org/check/).
## How occupational therapy can help you
Occupational therapy can help you with practical tasks if you:
* are physically disabled
* are recovering from an illness or operation
* have learning disabilities
* have mental health problems
* are getting older
Occupational therapists work with people of all ages and can look at all aspects of daily life in your home, school or workplace.
They look at activities you find difficult and see if there's another way you can do them.
The Royal College of Occupational Therapists has more information about [what occupational therapy is](https://www.rcotss-ip.org.uk/what-is-occupational-therapy).
