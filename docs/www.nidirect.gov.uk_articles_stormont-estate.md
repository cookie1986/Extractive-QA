## Green Flag Awards
In 2022 Stormont Estate  was awarded its ninth consecutive Green Flag award. The Green Flag award is the benchmark national standard for parks and green spaces in the UK. It measures the quality of the management, operation and improvement of free public parks and green spaces. It was first launched in 1996 to recognise and reward the best green spaces in the country and is an internationally recognised certification.
The Awards are judged annually by a panel of experts, who volunteer their time to assess the management plans and the applicant sites through a tough judging process.
Stormont Estate has also been awarded the Green Heritage Award for the third year. The award recognises the historic importance of the site.
