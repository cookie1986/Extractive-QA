# Welcome to Anxiety UK
In 1970, the charity’s founders, Katharine and Harold Fisher established The Phobics’ Society from their home in Chorlton, Manchester, as a direct result of Katharine’s personal experience of agoraphobia and with the sole aim of getting support in place for others living with anxiety..
 
Since then we’ve become a national organisation, however we still have the same [basic aims](/our-mission-values/). Whether you have anxiety, stress, anxiety-based depression or a phobia that’s affecting your daily life, we’re here to help and are here for you.
## Make anxiety a thing of the past
We offer an extensive range of support services designed to help control  anxiety rather than letting it control you.
Services available for **both members and non-members** include:
* Access to a community of other like-minded people
* Discounted one-to-one [therapy services](/get-help/access-therapy/) from our network of Anxiety UK Approved Therapists
* A wide range of [helpful resources](/shop/) to help you understand and overcome anxiety
* Access to [anxiety support groups](/get-help/anxiety-uk-courses-and-groups/)
* Discounted [Art for Anxiety Relief (AfAR) courses](https://www.anxietyuk.org.uk/get-help/anxiety-uk-courses-and-groups/)
* Discounted [anxiety management courses](/get-help/anxiety-uk-courses-and-groups/)

This was absolutely not the case, and I was assigned a therapist super quickly! They were also super helpful when unfortunately our schedules didn't align, and I was matched with a therapist with availability that matched mine. I really recommend AnxietyUK to everyone- they also have fantastic group resources and I think it's really really helpful, especially if you can't afford private therapy and the wait lists in your area are too long.![Susie Kocher](https://www.anxietyuk.org.uk/wp-content/plugins/widget-google-reviews/assets/img/guest.png "Susie Kocher")[Susie Kocher](https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102118975973349810551/reviews)14:31 20 Aug 22I found the therapy I received through Anxiety UK a crucial and affordable form of support during a very difficult time.For this I am forever grateful and will without a doubt use their services if needed again in the future.Thank you so much.![Joan Treloggan](https://www.anxietyuk.org.uk/wp-content/plugins/widget-google-reviews/assets/img/guest.png "Joan Treloggan")[Joan Treloggan](https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112280333732625677830/reviews)12:28 03 Aug 22Felt I was being listened to and felt I belonged.

One of the resources I used was the counselling and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. I paid for this but my fee was really small and worth every penny. Therapists are all qualified Healthcare Professionals who give up their time to help.Personally I feel Anxiety UK offers a fantastic service which fills that much needed gap between being referred to NHS and your actual appointment time which nowadays due to Covid can be up to a year in waiting time.Please don't wait and suffer just visit the Anxiety UK website and see for yourself !!![Tori Fenton](https://www.anxietyuk.org.uk/wp-content/plugins/widget-google-reviews/assets/img/guest.png "Tori Fenton")[Tori Fenton](https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117710854113502010242/reviews)20:19 30 Nov 21Amazing experience!
