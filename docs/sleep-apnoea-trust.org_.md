# What is Sleep Apnoea?
# **Click here    This is the sound of a person with sleep apnoea**
You stop breathing frequently when you are asleep. It happens many times every hour.  
But you do not hear yourself.  
However, your partner your family and even your neighbours do hear you.  
They wait in anticipation for you to start breathing again.  
**Office Hours: 09:30 to 17:30, Monday to Friday**

* [#### SATAday 2022 Online - a great success](#tab-6bab8bd32e97b72e90b)
On the 15th October 2022, SATA held its third annual sleep apnoea patients conference online as a virtual event for its members and NHS staff. While Travel was the main feature, covering all aspects from healthcare to the practical aspects that need taking into account when on the move, the R&D section covered the latest attempts to find alternatives to CPAP therapy. The Q&A session was wide ranging and covered many areas of concern, from CPAP shortages to increased risks of dementia and cancer. This Restless Leg Syndrome (also known as Periodic Limb Movement) was of concern and delegates were directed towards the new section in the Q&As on our website under the Patient Information heading. Members will soon be able to view the Conference recording in the Member’s Area of the website.
