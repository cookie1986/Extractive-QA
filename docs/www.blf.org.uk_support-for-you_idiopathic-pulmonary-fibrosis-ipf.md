### 
 [What is IPF?](/conditions/idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-ipf/what-ipf)
 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lung condition that scars your lungs and reduces the efficiency of your breathing.

### 
 [What causes IPF?](/conditions/idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-ipf/what-causes-ipf)
 Idiopathic means the cause is not known, but researchers now believe that the body creates fibrosis (scarring) in response to an injury to the lung.

### 
 [How is IPF diagnosed?](/conditions/idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-ipf/how-ipf-diagnosed)
 A team of several experts (called a multi-disciplinary team), often at specialist hospitals, will collect information about you before making a diagnosis. This is because there are many types of pulmonary fibrosis.

### 
 [Treating and managing IPF](/conditions/idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-ipf/treating-managing-ipf)
