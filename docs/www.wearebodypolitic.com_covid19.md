### covid-19 support group
![Screen Shot 2021-05-10 at 3.09.34 PM.png]()
***When members of our team fell ill with Covid-19 in March 2020 we launched the Body Politic Covid-19 Support Group*** *for patients and caregivers. Since then, our group has grown to include 13k+ members, and birthed grassroots initiatives such as* [*Long COVID SOS*](https://www.longcovidsos.org/) *and the* [*Patient-Led Research Collaborative*](https://patientresearchcovid19.com/)*, among other Covid-19 patient advocacy campaigns.****Today, the support group continues to add new members everyday. Our space provides people who have had COVID-19 with emotional support from peers, resources and education, community, and opportunities to participate in media and advocacy.***
[Join the group](https://forms.gle/x3RoWbjQBw9bYaYy9) 
## FAQ:
## + I'm a patient, how do I join?
The following individuals are welcome in our support group:
* people experiencing COVID-19 symptoms
* people who previously had COVID-19. This includes people who suspect they had COVID-19 but could not access testing
* people recovering from COVID-19 or experiencing symptoms after COVID-19
* people who have tested positive for COVID-19 (you do not have to have a positive test to join the group!)
* caretakers and immediate family of COVID-19 patients who are currently too sick to actively participate in the group
To join, please fill out the form linked above on the button labeled *Join the Group*. We just need to know a little bit about what you’re going through to verify that you’re a real person in need of support, but all information you share on that form is private and will only be accessible to admins of the group. Please use our [resources page](/resources) and check out our [past events](/events) for educational resources on Long COVID.
## + What is the Body Politic COVID-19 Support Group, and how did it form?
Body Politic started the COVID-19 support group after Founder and EIC Fiona Lowenstein, and Creative Director Sabrina Bleich [became sick with coronavirus](https://www.wearebodypolitic.com/bodytype/2020/3/25/letter-to-our-community) in early March. After falling ill, we quickly realized that there was not enough online content or resources dedicated to people struggling with coronavirus. As we scrolled through Instagram feeds filled with tips on navigating boredom during quarantine, or how not to catch the virus, we felt increasingly isolated, misunderstood, and ignored. With news of infection rates rising, we knew a community of people like ourselves existed, and was growing - we just needed a way to reach each other. 
We launched the Body Politic COVID-19 support group on March 26 in a small Instagram group chat. During those early days, while Fiona and Sabrina were still navigating acute physical symptoms, our incredible Operations Manager and ally, Lida Rubanava, stepped in to help us develop the group - she’s been an indispensable member of the support group admin team ever since. Since our launch, we’ve had **over 25,000 people sign up to join our patient-only support group (which currently houses over 12,000 members) and our [Ally Support Network](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSedrKr5e43Sid_H3mijLzVAMwFXM6ITh9t92jjpYAg37zbS8w/viewform).** We have migrated platforms to Slack to accommodate the growth and allow for small discussion channels based on community or topic. Our group consists of people from all over the world who have tested positive, are experiencing symptoms, or are recovering from COVID-19. Our discussion groups includes 50+ channels for based around different communities and topics. Some of our channels include one for those symptomatic for 30+ days or 90+ days, caretakers of sick friends or relatives, those who have recovered from being on ventilators, those experiencing known and lesser known symptom groups such as respiratory, neurological, GI, and others, and forums to discuss mental health, financial and employment concerns, medical advocacy, along with many others.
## + How can I help, if I’m outside the COVID-19 community?
The most impactful way to help is to [DONATE & RAISE MONEY](https://bit.ly/donatebodypolitic)  for one-time or recurring monthly tax-deductible donation via our fiscal sponsor Springboard HealthLab, EIN 87-1818608, 5601 Van Fleet Ave, Richmond, CA 94804. Include “Body Politic” in Paypal note or check memo. Funding to support our operations allows us to keep the support group running. ***Our support group is completely free and open to anyone with a history of COVID-19, but our operating costs are not free. We need your monetary support so we can continue supporting people living with Long COVID in the US and internationally.***
Other ways to get involved:
* Request to [join our Ally Support Network](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSedrKr5e43Sid_H3mijLzVAMwFXM6ITh9t92jjpYAg37zbS8w/viewform). We are especially interested in hearing from healthcare providers, wellness practitioners, lawyers, activists, and others with relevant experience in healthcare, chronic illness and disabilities, health justice, and emerging infectious diseases.
* If you are a researcher who wants to share your study or partner with us, please reach out to [info@wearebodypolitic.com](https://www.gofundme.com/f/fuav69-body-politic-covid19-support-group). We will review survey submissions and research opportunities to share with the support group as appropriate.
* Are you affiliated with a company or non-profit that can support this work in some way? For more information on partnerships, email [info@wearebodypolitic.com](mailto:info@wearebodypolitic.com) with a short description of your organization or brand and how you would like to collaborate.
* Provide a discounted service to our community. Are you a therapist, yoga teacher, medical professional, chef, or someone who provides a service that you think would be helpful for our community of sick and recovering people? Email [info@wearebodypolitic.com](mailto:info@wearebodypolitic.com) and we’ll determine if it’s a good fit to share.
* Apply to be a support group moderator. As our support group grows, we will need more moderators to manage conversation flow, and make sure members are following the groups’ rules and guidelines. Email [info@wearebodypolitic.com](mailto:info@wearebodypolitic.com), and we can tell you more about this opportunity.
If you are a reporter, please reach out to [PR@wearebodypolitic.com](mailto:PR@wearebodypolitic.com) to connect with members of the group. The support group is a private space for patients and caregivers only.
