 Book an appointment using the NHS e-Referral Service
If you've been referred to a specialist through the NHS e-Referral Service, booking your appointment online is easy, safe and secure.
The "Start now" button below will open the NHS e-Referral Service booking website: Manage Your Referral.
You'll need your:
* booking reference number
* password or access code
If you do not have these details, contact the person or organisation that referred you.
[Start now](https://refer.nhs.uk/)
You can also use the "Start now" button to:
* check your appointment details
* change your appointment
* cancel your appointment
* cancel your referral
See the [NHS England leaflet about what happens when you're referred by your GP to see a specialist (PDF only, 1.4MB)](https://assets.nhs.uk/prod/documents/Print-ready_PatientReferral_PRINT.pdf).
We want as many people as possible to use our service. The Manage Your Referral [accessibility statement](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/e-referral-service/document-library/myr-accessibility-statement) gives details about how accessible this website is and how we are improving your experience.
## Choosing your hospital or clinic
You may have more than one hospital or clinic to choose from. But the options will be the same if you book online or over the phone.
Consider all the options before choosing a hospital or clinic and appointment slot.
For example:
* How long do I have to wait for my first appointment?
* How quickly can I start my treatment?
* How far away is the hospital or clinic?
In most cases, you have the legal right to choose the hospital or service you'd like to go to. This includes private hospitals, as long as they provide NHS services.
Learn more about [your choices in the NHS](/using-the-nhs/about-the-nhs/your-choices-in-the-nhs/).
## What to do if you've not been referred
Speak to a GP if you want to be seen at a hospital or clinic. They'll help you decide what care is best for you and make any necessary referrals.
