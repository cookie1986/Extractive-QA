## 
 Never change or stop taking your medicines without talking to your doctor
Your GP, specialist or asthma nurse can talk to you about different treatment options for your condition. They will help you get the best care.
## Inhalers
Using a steroid inhaler or taking steroids through a nebuliser can cause oral thrush.  
Oral thrush is not contagious. This means you can still kiss and have sex with your partner, and they will not get it. 
You’re less likely to get oral thrush if you rinse your mouth after using your inhaler and have good inhaler technique. Watch our quick [inhaler videos](https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/inhaler-videos/) to find out more. 
## Oxygen
It’s safe to have sex while using oxygen. Ask your respiratory team if you need to use a higher oxygen setting for activity.  
## Non-invasive ventilation (NIV)
If you are using [non-invasive ventilation (NIV)](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/copd/treatment) you should speak to your healthcare team or specialist before having sex.
## Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy
If you have [obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/osa), long-term continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) could make sex more enjoyable. 
CPAP therapy can help erectile dysfunction too. 
## Steroids
If you’ve been taking steroid tablets for a long time, you might get [side effects](https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/severe-asthma/treating-severe-asthma/steroids-long-term-use/#risks). Side effects like ‘moon face’, weight gain, or mood changes might impact your confidence.  
The NHS have more information about [managing the side effects of steroid tablets](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/steroid-tablets/#side-effects). 
## Antidepressants
If you’re taking antidepressants, they can lower your sex drive.  You might also find it harder to orgasm during sex or masturbation.  Your GP might recommend a different type of antidepressant if this is a problem for you. 
We have a lot of information about [how to look after your mental health](/living-with/mental-health "Mental health and well-being"). 
## Antibiotics
Antibiotics can cause [genital thrush](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/thrush-in-men-and-women/) (sometimes called a yeast infection). Thrush can be spread through sex, but this is uncommon. It’s still best to avoid sex until thrush has gone, as it can make sex uncomfortable.
## Cancer treatments
Treatments for lung cancer or mesothelioma can lower your sex drive. Cancer Research have [more information about sex and cancer](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/coping/physically/sex/low-sex-drive).
