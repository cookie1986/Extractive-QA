## 
 How often do you use your reliever inhaler?
Did you know that using your reliever inhaler three times a week or more is a sign that your asthma is not well controlled. See your GP or asthma nurse for an asthma review as soon as you can.
## Take action now to lower your risk of an asthma attack
If you’re getting more asthma symptoms it’s a sign that your airways are getting more inflamed and narrow. This makes it harder for air to get through and means an asthma attack is more likely.
The sooner you can treat the inflammation in your airways, the sooner you can lower your risk of [an asthma attack.](https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/asthma-attacks/what-are-asthma-attacks/)
### See your doctor today
* Ask the receptionist for an urgent same day appointment. Tell them your asthma’s getting worse and you need to see a GP or asthma nurse for urgent advice to avoid having an asthma attack.
* If you can’t get an urgent same day appointment, or your GP surgery is closed, [call 111 for advice](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/urgent-and-emergency-care/nhs-111/). They may be able to arrange for you to be seen at a walk-in centre or by an out of hours doctor.
## Your GP or asthma nurse can help your asthma symptoms
There’s a lot your GP or asthma nurse can do to help stop symptoms building up to an asthma attack. Book an appointment now to get the support you need to lower your risk.
### Your GP/asthma nurse can:
* Talk to you about why your asthma symptoms have got worse
* Check you’re taking [your preventer medicine](https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/inhalers-medicines-treatments/inhalers-and-spacers/preventer/) every day. If you haven’t been taking it regularly, they can suggest ways to get into a good routine with it so it’s easier to remember
* Look at [your inhaler technique](https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/inhaler-videos/) to make sure you’re getting the medicine you need
* Suggest a higher dose, or more puffs, of your preventer inhaler for a while
* Consider [a change of medicines](https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/inhalers-medicines-treatments/changing-medicines/), or a new type of inhaler device
* Prescribe a short course of [oral steroids](https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/inhalers-medicines-treatments/steroids/)
* Give advice about allergies like [hay fever](https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/triggers/pollen/) which can make your symptoms worse
* Update your [asthma action plan](https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/manage-your-asthma/action-plan/) so you can feel confident you know what to do every day to stay well, and what action to take when your symptoms get worse

## Why have your asthma symptoms got worse?
Before your appointment, have a think about your symptoms and why you think they’ve got worse. It’ll help you and your GP to work out what’s going on with your asthma.
Ask yourself these questions to help you:
### Have I been taking my preventer inhaler every day?
Preventer medicines stop inflammation building up in your airways. But they can only do this if you take them every day.
If you stop taking them you won’t have full protection. And your symptoms will come back.
Have you been taking yours every day? Or have you found it hard to get into a good routine?
### Do I know the best way to take my inhalers?
Even if you’ve been taking an inhaler for years, it’s easy to slip into bad habits. If you haven’t been taking your inhaler correctly you will have been missing out on the full dose of asthma medicine.
Are you confident you’re taking your inhalers in the right way? [Watch our inhaler videos to see if you’re doing it right.](https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/inhaler-videos/) And ask your GP or asthma nurse to check it at your appointment.
### Have I been around more of my usual asthma triggers?
Maybe you’ve caught a cold, or it’s pollen season and your hay fever’s bad. Think about [your usual triggers](https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/triggers/) and if they might be affecting you more.
### Have I come across a new trigger?
Have you been around an animal or pet? Did you start a new job, or go on holiday? Tell your doctor if you’ve spotted a new trigger. They can help you deal with it.
### What else has been going on in my life lately?
Think about when you first noticed symptoms getting worse. Was there something stressful going on? Was there a big family event, or upset, or something happening at work?
[Stress and emotions](https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/triggers/emotions/) can be triggers for your asthma symptoms too.
### Have I noticed hormonal changes?
Asthma symptoms can get worse for some women before and during your period, during pregnancy, and around the menopause.
Your GP or asthma nurse can help you manage your asthma during [times of hormonal change.](https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/triggers/hormones/)
