## ChILD Diseases
 
**Children’s Interstitial and Diffuse Lung Disease (chILD)** is not a single disease. Instead, it is a group of rare lung diseases found in infants, children, and adolescents. There are different kinds of chILD. Although they’re all considered rare diseases, some forms are more common in specific age groups.
Many types of chILD affect the [interstitium](https://www.livescience.com/62128-interstitium-organ.html)[,](https://www.livescience.com/62128-interstitium-organ.html) a thin tissue between tiny air sacs and blood vessels in the lungs. Some kinds of chILD involve other areas in the lungs, too.
There are different types of chILD that vary in their severity and in their long-term outcomes. In simplest terms, all types of chILD decrease a child’s ability to supply oxygen to their body. Early diagnosis and treatment is important for any form of chILD. If you suspect your child has chILD, speak to you doctor who will refer you to a respiratory consultant with expertise in chILD.
