# How to start
Through insight, we know that many disabled people would like to be more active. There are many ways to enjoy an active lifestyle  - including sports for people with specific impairments, and inclusive sessions where disabled and non-disabled people can take part together.

Achieving a goal, however small, is empowering. This will boost self-confidence in all areas of life. Exercise may tire us at the time but in the long-term it will give us more energy. We may sometimes find that regular exercise makes it easier to complete our every day activities, like getting up and dressed in the morning.
It also improves sleep which means we get a double-boost to our energy levels. It helps memory, brain function and will reduce stress. Exercising is also a great time to do some thinking and problem-solving.
Getting active will become fun (even if it isn’t at first!). And the more fun it is, the more we’ll benefit.
If you are not as active as you would like to be or you know someone who isn't, we have lots of resources or contacts to help you on your way. Here are a few ideas:
* Read our [Being Active Guide](/how-we-help/resources "Being Active Guide") to see how you can get started. It is for everyone with lived experience of disability or health conditions. We wrote the Guide in partnership with Disability Rights UK and it provides the information you need in a quick, easy format.
* Check out the [local opportunities promoted on our site](/get-active/events "local opportunities here").
* There is a fantastic online search tool called [Parasport](https://parasport.org.uk/ "Parasport"), powered by Toyota.
* We also have [partnerships](/about-us/partners "partnerships") with local and UK wide organisations. Some of these are the National Disability Sport Organisations. They can offer advice and opportunities for people with specific impairments.
* You can find local [IFI Mark accredited gyms here](/get-active/inclusive-gyms "IFI Gyms").
### We hope you find enough information on our site to get started. [Get in touch](/contact-us "Get in touch") and tell us how you enjoy being active too!
