## Telling a new partner about your lung condition
Being open about your lung condition means that your partner will be able to help you manage your condition. It also means that they will be prepared if you have an asthma attack or flare-up. 
Only speak to your partner when you feel comfortable and ready. 
> “Your lung condition is part of you, but it’s not the whole story.” – Caroline, Respiratory Nurse Specialist at Asthma + Lung UK. “There’s no need to tell somebody right away if you don’t want to. It might just come up naturally in conversation.”

## Going on dates with a lung condition
Bars, restaurants, and pubs are popular places for dates. There are a few things that could make your symptoms worse in places like this: 
* [indoor air pollution](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/indoor-air-pollution/causes-and-effects)
* [food](https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/triggers/food/)
* [alcohol](https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/triggers/alcohol/).
Going on a date might also cause [strong emotions](https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/triggers/emotions/), which could be a trigger if you have asthma. 
## Using medicines in front of a partner
Whether you’re single or in a relationship, you might feel nervous about using your medicines in front of a partner. It’s really important to keep taking your medicines as prescribed, because otherwise your symptoms could turn into an asthma attack or flare-up.
If you feel nervous or embarrassed, try to remember: 
* Lung conditions are common. 1 in 5 people in the UK live with a lung condition. This means that most people live with a lung condition, or know somebody who does
* You don’t have to let them know immediately that you have a lung condition. You could take your medicines in private, for example in the bathroom, until you feel ready.
## 
 Manage your asthma
Managing your asthma well means that you’re less likely to react to triggers and less likely to use your reliever inhaler. Keep your asthma under control with our [asthma action plans](https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/manage-your-asthma/action-plan/). 
## Relationships
Everyone is different when it comes to relationships. It is important that you’re able to talk to your partner about your feelings, especially when you’re living with a long term lung condition. 
If you need extra help with the emotional side of your relationship,  relationship counselling could help. It can help you and your partner explore your feelings and suggest practical steps for moving forward. You can [find relationship counselling services through the NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/other-services/Relationship counselling/LocationSearch/400).
We also have a lot of information about how to manage your [mental health while living with a lung condition](/living-with/mental-health "Mental health and well-being").
