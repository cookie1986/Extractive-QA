# Epworth Sleepiness Scale
The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is used to diagnose obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).
If you suspect you might have OSA, answer the following questions and take your answers to your GP.
## Epworth Sleepiness Scale
How likely are you to doze off or fall asleep in the following situations, in comparison to feeling just tired? This refers to your usual way of life in recent times.
Even if you haven't done some of these things recently, try to work out how they would have affected you.
> Use the following scale to choose the most appropriate number for each situation:
> 
> 
> 0 = would never doze  
> 1 = slight chance of dozing  
> 2 = moderate chance of dozing  
> 3 = high chance of dozing
> 
> 
> 
It's important that you answer each question as best you can.
| Situation | Score (0-3) |
| --- | --- |
| Sitting and reading |  |
| Watching TV |  |
| Sitting still in a public place (e.g. a theatre, a cinema or a meeting) |  |
| As a passenger in a car for an hour without a break |  |
| Lying down to rest in the afternoon when the circumstances allow |  |
| Sitting and talking to someone |  |
| Sitting quietly after lunch without having drunk alcohol |  |
| In a car or bus while stopped for a few minutes in traffic |  |
| Total |  |
## What does my score mean?
Talk to your GP about your circumstances. Scores can be interpreted as follows:
* **0-5** lower normal daytime sleepiness
* **6-10** normal daytime sleepiness
* **11-12** mild excessive daytime symptoms
* **13-15** moderate excessive daytime symptoms
* **16-24** severe excessive daytime symptoms
