*Have wheelchair, will travel...*
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Wheelchair space on Eurostar train 
**A wheelchair space on a Eurostar**.  An accessible toilet is 
right next door.  There are similar wheelchair 
spaces on Thalys trains from Brussels to Amsterdam & 
Cologne, and on TGVs from Lille to destinations all over 
France, and from Paris to Switzerland & Milan. |

If you're a wheelchair user, you can easily book a wheelchair space on Eurostar 
from London to Lille, Paris, Brussels or Amsterdam, then book an onwards 
wheelchair space on a train to other French cities, Switzerland, Milan or 
Barcelona.  You can even book yourself a wheelchair-accessible couchette on 
the sleeper train from Paris or Brussels to Salzburg or Vienna.  On this 
page I'll tell you how to book yourself a wheelchair space on these trains 
online, or if you'd rather talk to someone and have them book it for you, I'll 
explain who to call.

Although I'm familiar with all the trains, accessible travel is not something I'm 
100% qualified to research myself, so I'd really value any feedback.  If 
you can help add to this page, [please 
get in touch](email.htm)!

[If you'd rather talk 
to someone, who to call?](european-train-travel-with-special-needs.htm#who-to-call-for-train-travel-with-disabilities)
# Step 1,
travel with disability in 
Britain
* For travel within the UK, start with this page on the National Rail site: 
 [www.nationalrail.co.uk/ stations\_destinations/ disabled\_passengers.aspx](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/disabled_passengers.aspx).
* You can book tickets as 
 normal, then call to arrange a wheelchair space and assistance or do it 
 through the Passenger Assist mobile app, or the assistance booking forms on 
 every train operator's website.
* *Tip:*  It may be 
better to book assistance and a wheelchair space first, then buy the tickets!
# 
Step 2, travel with disability 
on Eurostar
* It's no problem to travel by 
Eurostar from London to Paris, Lille, Brussels, Rotterdam or Amsterdam, even if 
you're a permanent wheelchair user or have other special needs.  Each Eurostar 
train has a wheelchair space in several 1st class cars, adjacent to a 
wheelchair-accessible toilet with push-button access.
There are special fares for 
people travelling in wheelchairs and one travelling companion, these give 1st 
class travel (with food & wine included!) at the 2nd class rate.
* You can book wheelchair 
travel online at
[www.eurostar.com](booking/eurostar.htm), just click 
 *Wheelchair* under the passenger box on 
the journey planner on their home page.
This automatically alerts them 
that assistance is required onto & off the train, but you can always call them 
to confirm on **03432 186 186** 
or email them via
[www.eurostar.com](booking/eurostar.htm).  
For more information, see
[www.eurostar.com/uk-en/travel-info/travel-planning/accessibility](https://www.eurostar.com/uk-en/travel-info/travel-planning/accessibility).
* You could also consider 
travelling by ferry from London to Amsterdam, see
 [www.stenaline.co.uk](http://www.stenaline.co.uk) (Harwich-Hoek van Holland),
 [www.dfds.co.uk](https://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p=40244&a=1104089&g=16178380) 
(Newcastle-IJmuiden near Amsterdam).
# 
How to change stations in Paris
* Changing trains in Brussels, 
Amsterdam and (usually) Lille means an easy same-station change.  In Paris, 
it's a 10-minute walk or wheelchair push from the
 [Gare du Nord](stations/paris-gare-du-nord.htm) where Eurostar arrives 
to the [Gare de l'Est](stations/paris-est.htm) for trains to Reims, Strasbourg, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and the 
Nightjet sleeper to Salzburg & Vienna.
* However, journeys through Paris 
to the south of France, Switzerland, Italy & Spain usually mean changing 
stations from the [Gare 
 du Nord](stations/paris-gare-du-nord.htm) to the [Gare de Lyon](stations/paris-gare-de-lyon.htm) or 
 [Gare Montparnasse](stations/paris-gare-montparnasse.htm). 
 For this there's a 
pre-bookable wheelchair-accessible taxi service run by
G7 Taxis, [www.g7.fr](http://www.g7.fr).
To book, call **+33 1 41 27 
66 99** (English speaking line) or **+33 1 47 
39 00 91**, making sure you ask for a wheelchair 
accessible taxi.
There's a €5 booking fee, and 
bookings can be made from 7 days until 1 hour before you 
need the taxi.  Gare du Nord to Gare d'Austerlitz for 
example costs €13-€19 per taxi.  [Feedback](email.htm) from 
users of this service would be very welcome!  *Tip:  Sometimes they 
decline to pick up at stations.  If so, for pickup at the Gate du Nord 
suggest 'Boulevard de Denain' instead, this is the road immediately leading off 
in front of you when you leave the Gare du Nord's main exit.  You might 
want to call when you know you have arrived.*
* There are also wheelchair-accessible buses.  Bus 91 is 
wheelchair-accessible & links Gare du Nord, Gare de l'Est, Gare de Lyon & Gare 
Montparnasse. See [www.ratp.fr](http://www.ratp.fr).
# 
Step 3, travel with 
disabilitybeyond Eurostar
* Once on the Continent, most modern daytime trains have accommodation for 
passengers travelling in wheelchairs.  Some operators (such as SNCF in 
France, ÖBB in Austria) allow wheelchair users to book tickets with a wheelchair 
space themselves online.  Others require you to call them.
* Incidentally, don't buy regular tickets online, then try to add a wheelchair 
space (as you would in Britain).  In many countries ticket purchase and the 
booking of a wheelchair space need to be done together as part of the same 
transaction.
* For more information about 
arrangements for travellers with 
disabilities in each country, start with the website of the 
relevant national train operator, see the list of websites 
on the [useful links page](links.htm).
### 
...to France:
* First look at the
 [London to France page](France.htm) to see if you can travel to your French destination 
with an easy same-station change at Lille as this avoids having to cross Paris.  
 This is possible for many destinations including Nice, Marseille, Cannes, Bordeaux, 
Strasbourg, Toulouse, Avignon, Nantes, Nîmes & Montpellier.  At Lille 
there are lifts & escalators to all four platforms.  All TGV trains 
have wheelchair spaces and wheelchair-friendly toilets.
* For other destinations, for example Vichy, Clermont-Ferrand or Cahors, you'll 
need to go via Paris, see the info above about accessible taxis.
* To book, work out your train times,
 [see the London to France page](France.htm).
* Then book from London to Lille or Paris at
 [www.eurostar.com](booking/eurostar.htm), just click 
 *Wheelchair* under the passenger box on 
the journey planner on their home page.  This automatically alerts Eurostar 
to the need for assistance on and off the train.
* Then book tickets from Lille or Paris to your French destination with a 
wheelchair space at the French Railways website
 [www.sncf-connect.com](booking/sncf.htm).  For 
English, scroll right at the bottom and select *Europe (other countries)*.  
Then click on the first traveller and tick the *Disabled passenger* and *Wheelchair user* boxes.
* After booking, arrange assistance on and off the train by filling in the Access 
Plus form, see
 [www.sncf.com/en/passenger-offer/travel-for-everyone/accessibility/special-assistance](https://www.sncf.com/en/passenger-offer/travel-for-everyone/accessibility/special-assistance).  
You will need to enter the 6-character reservation code from your ticket 
booking.
### 
...to Switzerland:
* Take Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord, where there is level 
access off the platforms straight onto the concourse and the 
street.  You will need to 
arrange transport from Paris Nord to Paris Gare de 
Lyon, perhaps using a
 [wheelchair-accessible taxi](european-train-travel-with-special-needs.htm#Wheelchair-accessible taxi service).  All the 
 [TGV-Lyria high-speed 
trains](trains-and-routes/lyria.htm) from Paris Gare de Lyon to Geneva, Lausanne, Basel & Zurich have 
wheelchair places and wheelchair-accessible toilets.
* Book from London to Paris at
 [www.eurostar.com](booking/eurostar.htm), just click 
 *Wheelchair* under the passenger box on 
the journey planner on their home page.  This automatically alerts Eurostar 
to the need for assistance on and off the train. 
Allow lots of time in Paris, ideally 2-3 hours.
* Then book tickets from Paris to Geneva, Lausanne, Basel or Zurich with a 
wheelchair space at the French Railways website
 [www.sncf-connect.com](booking/sncf.htm).  For 
English, scroll right at the bottom and select *Europe (other countries)*.  
Then click on the first traveller and tick the *Disabled passenger* and *Wheelchair user* boxes.
* After booking, arrange assistance on and off the train by filling in the Access 
Plus form, see
 [www.sncf.com/en/passenger-offer/travel-for-everyone/accessibility/special-assistance](https://www.sncf.com/en/passenger-offer/travel-for-everyone/accessibility/special-assistance).  
You will need to enter the 6-character reservation code from your ticket 
booking.
### 
...to Italy:
* Take Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord.  You will need to 
arrange transport across Paris to the Gare de Lyon, for 
example using the
 [wheelchair-accessible taxi](european-train-travel-with-special-needs.htm#Wheelchair-accessible taxi service).  
Then take a daytime TGV train from Paris to Turin & Milan 
as these have 
wheelchair places and wheelchair-accessible toilets,
 [for 
details see the Italy page](Italy.htm#Option 2:  London to Rome by TGV overnight Milan).
* Book from London to Paris at
 [www.eurostar.com](booking/eurostar.htm), just click 
 *Wheelchair* under the passenger box on 
the journey planner on their home page.  This automatically alerts Eurostar 
to the need for assistance on and off the train. 
Allow lots of time in Paris, ideally 2-3 hours.
* Then book TGV tickets from Paris to Milan with a wheelchair space at the French 
Railways website
[www.sncf-connect.com](booking/sncf.htm).  For 
English, scroll right at the bottom and select *Europe (other countries)*.  
Then click on the first traveller and tick the *Disabled passenger* and *Wheelchair user* boxes.
* After booking Paris-Milan with SNCF, arrange assistance on and off the train by 
filling in the Access Plus form, see
 [www.sncf.com/en/passenger-offer/travel-for-everyone/accessibility/special-assistance](https://www.sncf.com/en/passenger-offer/travel-for-everyone/accessibility/special-assistance).  
You will need to enter the 6-character reservation code from your ticket 
booking.
* Once in Italy, most fast trains including 
 [Frecciarossa](trains-and-routes/frecciarossa.htm),
 [Frecciargento](trains-and-routes/frecciargento.htm) & 
 [Frecciabianca](train-travel-in-italy.htm#frecciabianca) services between major Italian cities have wheelchair spaces 
and wheelchair-accessible toilets.  For train times and 
how to buy tickets, [see the London to 
Italy page](Italy.htm).  You can arrange assistance at stations and assistance on 
and off trains (and, I believe,  get wheelchair spaces reserved on trains 
in Italy) at
 [www.rfi.it/rfi-en/For-persons-with-disability/Services-assistance-in-stations](http://www.rfi.it/rfi-en/For-persons-with-disability/Services-assistance-in-stations).
### 
...to Spain:
* Take Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord.  You will need to 
arrange transport across Paris to the Gare de Lyon, for 
example using the
 [wheelchair-accessible taxi](european-train-travel-with-special-needs.htm#Wheelchair-accessible taxi service).  Then take a
 [Paris-Barcelona 
TGV](trains-and-routes/paris-to-barcelona-by-train.htm) as shown on the [London to Spain page](Spain.htm).  
These have wheelchair spaces and accessible toilets.  You'll then also find 
these facilities on the onward Spanish AVE trains from Barcelona to Madrid, 
Malaga, Seville, Cordoba, Alicante, Valencia and most other Spanish 
destinations.  However, there are no wheelchair facilities on the French 
overnight trains between Paris and Perpignan, Latour de Carol or the Spanish 
border mentioned on that page.  There are direct ferries from 
the UK to Spain, with disabled/wheelchair facilities.  See 
 [www.brittany-ferries.co.uk](https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=15329&id=92204) 
(Plymouth-Santander, Portsmouth-Santander & Portsmouth-Bilbao).
* To travel from London to Barcelona by Eurostar & TGV, first book from London to 
Paris at
[www.eurostar.com](booking/eurostar.htm), just click 
 *Wheelchair* under the passenger box on 
the journey planner on their home page.  This automatically alerts Eurostar 
to the need for assistance on and off the train.
* Allow lots of time in Paris, ideally 2-3 hours.
* Then book TGV tickets from Paris to Barcelona with a wheelchair space at the 
French Railways website
[www.sncf-connect.com](booking/sncf.htm).  For 
English, scroll right at the bottom and select *Europe (other countries)*.  
Then click on the first traveller and tick the *Disabled passenger* and *Wheelchair user* boxes.
* After booking Paris-Barcelona with SNCF, arrange assistance on and off the train 
by filling in the Access Plus form, see
 [www.sncf.com/en/passenger-offer/travel-for-everyone/accessibility/special-assistance](https://www.sncf.com/en/passenger-offer/travel-for-everyone/accessibility/special-assistance).  
You will need to enter the 6-character reservation code from your ticket 
booking.
### 
...to Germany:
* Take Eurostar to Brussels or Paris.  In Brussels it's a 
simple same-station change with lifts to/from all platforms.  
In Paris, it's a 10-15 minute walk or wheelchair push from 
the Gare du Nord where Eurostar arrives to the Gare de l'Est 
where the trains to Germany depart.  From Brussels, 
there are [Thalys high-speed trains](trains-and-routes/thalys.htm) to Cologne all with 
wheelchair spaces and wheelchair-friendly toilets.  
From Cologne, there are wheelchair spaces and 
wheelchair-friendly toilets on almost all the 
 [InterCity](trains-and-routes/german-intercity-trains.htm) (IC) 
and [InterCityExpress](trains-and-routes/ice.htm) (ICE) trains to 
destinations all over Germany.  Boarding assistance can be provided at most 
major Germany stations.  From Paris Gare de l'Est there are direct TGV or 
ICE trains to Stuttgart, Munich, Frankfurt all with wheelchair spaces and 
wheelchair-accessible toilets.  For train times, fares & how to buy 
tickets, [see the London to Germany page](Germany.htm).  
There is a handicap brochure with more information on the

Traveller's reports
***Traveller Andrew Farrow went from London to Croatia by 
train in a wheelchair:*** 
I’m a permanent wheelchair user, with a 
'normal' manual wheelchair.  I need a ramp to get on to 
a train.  I can, with assistance, transfer to a normal 
seat and my wheelchair can be folded away - people with 
bigger or electric wheelchairs might have a different 
experience. Because of the hassle of sorting out ramps and 
assistance, I’d allow a minimum of at least 30 minutes to 
change trains at any station, preferably a lot longer. And 
despite the European Community supposedly being a place of 
common rules and regulations, this does not seem to apply to 
rail travel in a wheelchair, where each country has its own 
approach. Each country has different rules about companions 
or carers and a different mechanism for dealing with 
wheelchairs.  From my  experience so far, you need 
to be willing to be lifted in and out of trains, to accept 
not always being able to get to a toilet, to have to 
transfer from your chair and to have a lot of patience.  
That said, because of my wheelchair we met far more people 
and had far more wonderful encounters with strangers than we 
would have done otherwise.  Everywhere people were 
enormously friendly and helpful: partly as a result of my 
London–Split trip, I’ve decided I will now travel in Europe 
only by train.

I booked my Eurostar ticket online, a very easy process. The 
Paris–Split travel was all arranged by Deutsch Bahn. However, Deutsch Bahn could only 
arrange assistance in Germany, not Croatia. 

1. London - Paris:  Eurostar is wonderful for 
wheelchair users. There are only two wheelchair spaces in 
the entire train, so it’s worth booking early if you have to 
catch a specific train. Assistance does not need to be 
booked in advance, you don’t need to turn up especially 
early and you can check in at the normal check in desks. A 
(very grand) ramp is provided in both London and Paris (Gare 
du Nord). 

2. Paris - Munich:  Following your advice, we caught 
the overnight train from Paris Gare de l’Est [sadly discontinued from December 
2014], leaving at 
20:05, arriving Munich 07:10. This was a fantastic journey: 
we had an entire compartment to ourselves, although others 
could access the toilet! Instead of a four person couchette, 
our compartment was a two person couchette with a lot of 
extra room for wheeling about. Similarly, the toilet was 
enormous, with huge amounts of room. With this level of 
luxury, I doubt whether they can accommodate more than one 
wheelchair user, so book early. You need to get to Gare de 
L’Est at least half an hour before the train leaves and go 
to the Special Assistance office to find a staff member who 
will then find a ramp for you. We had to wait in Munich for 
a little while for a ramp to be found.

3. Munich – Zagreb:  Deutsch Bahn wouldn’t allow us to 
catch the suggested 08:27 from Munich to Zagreb as they said 
that there wouldn’t be enough time to make the change from 
one train to another (That actually turned out quite well, 
because when we arrived in Munich, we discovered it was 
Oktoberfest, so had time to walk down to the venue and 
experience literally tens of thousands of Germans in 
lederhosen celebrating and sampling enormous quantities of 
beer). Instead, they booked us on to the direct train to 
Zagreb leaving Munich at 12:27 and arriving Zagreb at 20:53, 
no changes necessary. 
Getting on the train in Munich was fine. However, this 
journey would not be possible for someone who cannot 
transfer from their wheelchair: I had to transfer from my 
chair to a seat at the end of the compartment as the 
corridor was too narrow to wheel down. There is no separate 
wheelchair space, and my chair had to be folded up. Given 
this experience, I doubt whether the toilet was accessible 
(I didn’t check). It was a comfortable train though, and the 
conductor very helpfully brought food and beer to our seats.

I was unsure what would happen when we got to Zagreb or 
Split. Whilst I had found contact details for Croatian 
Railways and did have an email conversation discussing what 
train times and carriages I was in (“We need these details 
so we could be able to organized your transportation”), I 
didn’t actually have confirmation that assistance or ramps 
would be available. In Zagreb, a ramp was eventually found 
and we descended. It’s an accessible station with no steps.  
We stayed the night in the Esplanade Hotel, about five 
minutes walk from the station and a glorious Art Deco hotel 
with very reasonable prices. It used to be the preferred 
venue for travellers stopping off en route on the old Orient 
Express leg from Istanbul to Zagreb apparently. This allowed 
us a morning to explore Zagreb, where there’s an original 
carriage from the Orient Express that’s been turned into a 
bar.

4. Zagreb – Split:  We left Zagreb at 14:04, arriving 
Split at 20:37. We arrived at Zagreb station 45 minutes 
before the train was due to leave and after a lot of 
confusion and discussion at the information desk, got taken 
to a side office and eventually a ramp was arranged. Again, 
I had to transfer from my wheelchair. Again, I doubt whether 
there were accessible toilets on board. At Split, no ramp 
but lots of strong helpful men to get me down. An accessible 
station, no steps.
***Traveller Jill Lindenbauer travelled from London to Valencia 
by train with her young son who uses a wheelchair***.  She 
reports:  "I feel so lucky to have 
Ebbsfleet International on my doorstep, and the 
staff which assisted William and I certainly made us feel 
like VIPs.  It was no trouble boarding 
the train and as William's carer we were privileged to sit 
in 1st class as this is where the wheelchair seating is 
situated, even though we only paid 2nd class 
fares.  Immediately we were asked if we wanted a drink, 
and a meal was provided, which I wasn't expecting. It 
certainly got the holiday off to a good start, and whilst 
travelling I received a call from the English-speaking G7 
Taxi service in France to say that our wheelchair-accessible 
taxi would be waiting when we arrived in Gare Du Nord.  
This is a quick and easy service to use and I booked our 
taxi in advance from the comfort of my own living-room.

When 
William and I reached Gare Du Nord that sunny evening 
there was the same buzz of activity as the ramp was 
prepared for the wheelchair, and a porter took my bags. I 
soon spotted my name on a white piece of card, but I'm 
guessing the taxi driver spotted my son and I as we made our way along the platform. 
The taxi driver took my bag and led the 
way to his vehicle outside. He swiftly organised the ramp and pushed William 
in his chair inside, where he secured William's wheelchair to the car floor 
with belts. The politeness and assistance of the taxi 
driver made our short trip effortless and at Gare 
D'Austerlitz he escorted us to the Information Office.  The 
taxi cost 40-50 euros, but the meter was probably running as 
we are leaving the train and as we are about the last to 
leave as we wait for special assistance this is a small 
price to pay.

At 
Gare d'Austerlitz the woman in the information desk 
shook her head as she saw my little boy's heavy manual wheelchair surrounded by luggage, and 
made hand signals to indicate how small 
the trenhotel to Barcelona was.  Around 8pm it 
arrived. The guard checked my ticket, which clearly 
stated "disabled passenger," and showed me our Gran Clase 
2-berth sleeper, which was the first one adjacent to the 
dining-car. Unfortunately I could see that there was no way 
I was going to be able to board the train or enter our cabin 
with the wheelchair, which was just a few centimetres too 
wide. So I unbelted William and sat him in the cabin propped 
up with some luggage and quickly dismantled the wheelchair 
which divides into three pieces, the main chair does not and 
this I placed on the second seat, the wheels disappeared 
into the shower area, and we soon had the cabin looking 
homely, as I sat William on my lap.
Dinner arrived as it was evident that we wouldn't be very 
popular blocking the dining-car. I was quite content eating and watching the scenery, but like most children 
my son was not happy with his dinner, even though there 
was a children's menu, so one of our rucksacks carried 
extra food supplies just in case! Our bed 
was made and sleep was welcome. All our luggage was on the 
top berth and made the cabin nice and spacious. The 
rolling and rattling of the carriages made me feel like I 
was being rocked in a cradle. 
Morning 
arrived, breakfast was served and Barcelona appeared. 
William and I were sitting in Parc De La Ciutadella in 
Barcelona at 9am, waiting for our final connection to 
Valencia.  At 10am we went to the Information Desk at 
the station, where they were expecting us. Unfortunately 
there was no ramp to be seen, and so I carried William on 
board whilst the female assistant asked a member of the 
public to help her place the wheelchair on the train. There 
was a  special area for this, which is called the "H" Seat. 
In comparison to the Trenhotel this train looked newer and 
wider.  The 
scenery along the coast was breathtaking, making us feel 
like peeping toms, as we would spurt through a dark tunnel 
to be met by bright sunlight and naked bodies on golden beaches. The journey passed quickly as the train filled and emptied 
at seaside stations. At one time the wheelchair was 
covered by a sea of other people's suitcases, which was a 
good thing William sat with me for most of the time. As 
the train pulled into Valencia I was geared up to take 
William off myself, but the three young men in uniforms 
bearing the wheelchair logo were already in the process of 
operating the ramp, and we became a fascinating spectacle 
for the Spanish public.
My tearful sister was there to greet us, waiting to hear of 
our travels, which I found to be fun and hassle free. Unlike 
the madness of airports and wondering if you are going to 
see your bags again I found the whole experience graceful 
and dignified. William and I and the faithful wheelchair by 
our side feel like we actually travelled and saw life, 
rather than being catapulted into the air, looking at 
the sky for a couple of hours, and then being trundled onto 
a bus to go and search for our luggage. 
When we 
returned we knew the process so it was even easier and the 
same taxi driver asked how we got on.  The only 
problem was both lifts at Gare Du Nord were out of action 
until 10th August, but I carried William up the escalator 
and my assistant at the station took the wheelchair.
