There’s a different way to [apply if you’re in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/information-and-services/motoring-and-transport/blue-badge-scheme).
A Blue Badge costs up to £10 in England and £20 in Scotland. It’s free in Wales.
They usually last up to 3 years.
You must reapply for a Blue Badge before your current one expires.
If you’re replacing a lost, stolen or damaged blue badge, and it is not expiring in the next 3 months, you need to [use a different service](/replace-lost-stolen-blue-badge).

## What you need to know
How you pay depends on your local council. They’ll usually make a decision within 12 weeks.
## If your application is refused

You can ask them to reconsider your case if you do not think all the important information you provided was taken into account.
You can also reapply if your mobility problems become more serious.
## If you need help
