**Low Emission Zone - Consultation Feedback**
Thank you for comments and feedback on the proposed Low Emission Zone Scheme. 
Following statutory consultation during summer 2021, the Council has entered a [Statutory Notice Period](https://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/city-mobility-plan-1/statutory-notice-period-proposal-make-low-emission-zone-scheme/1) for its Proposed Low Emission Zone Scheme.
A copy of the Statutory Notice (including on-street bill), Statement of Reasons and Consultation Document from the summer 2021 period may be found at the bottom of the page. All evidence relating to LEZ development is also available

## Overview
The City of Edinburgh Council aims to reduce air pollution, since it presents a significant threat to public health. It is especially harmful to young children, the elderly and those suffering from pre-existing conditions, including heart and lung diseases.
[Low Emission Zones (LEZs) are being introduced across Scotland’s four largest cities](https://www.lowemissionzones.scot/): Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee in response to dangerous levels of air pollution, primarily nitrogen dioxide (NO2), generated by road traffic.
Low Emission Zones (LEZs) aspire to improve public health, by discouraging the most polluting vehicles from entering an area. If a vehicle entering a LEZ does not meet the minimum exhaust emission standard, then a penalty fine is issued. The Zone is intended to only target the most polluting vehicles.
## Why your views matter
We are seeking views on the following proposed aspects of the Edinburgh LEZ:
* city centre zone boundary
* 2 -year grace period
* local exemptions and considerations for impacted groups
We are also seeking to understand knowledge of LEZs, [related support funds](https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/grants-and-loans/low-emission-zone-support-fund-for-households/) and grants and loans available for [other sustainable transport options](https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/travel/financial-support/grants-and-loans/). 
Full scheme details are available in the [‘Proposal to make a LEZ’](user_uploads/lez-consultation-document-june-2021.pdf) or you can find a [summary on our website](http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/lowemissionzone).
The survey should take around 10 minutes to complete.
Responses, comments or feedback can also be emailed to: [low.emission.zone@edinburgh.gov.uk](file://corpad.corp.edinburgh.gov.uk/departments/CDev/PBS/Spatial_Policy/3%20projects/LEZ/08%20Comms%20&%20Engagement/02%20Consultation/low.emission.zone@edinburgh.gov.uk), or posted to: *Low Emission Zone, Waverley Court G3, 4 East Market Street, Edinburgh, EH8 8BG*
