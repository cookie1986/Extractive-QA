# Erythema nodosum
**Erythema nodosum is swollen fat under the skin causing bumps and patches that look red or darker than surrounding skin. It usually goes away by itself, but it can be a sign of something serious.**

You may also have flu-like symptoms, such as:
* a high temperature
* tiredness
* joint and muscle pain
### If you're not sure it's erythema nodosum
Check other types of [lumps](/conditions/lumps/).
## How you can ease the pain yourself
* try [ibuprofen](/medicines/ibuprofen-for-adults/)
* rest with your feet raised on a pillow
* apply a cool wet compress, like a damp cloth
The colour of the bumps and patches usually changes and fades, like a bruise.
The bumps usually heal on their own within 3 to 8 weeks without leaving a scar. But other symptoms, such as joint pain, may last several weeks or months.
## A pharmacist can help with erythema nodosum
If you're in pain, a pharmacist can recommend:
* stronger painkillers
* supportive bandages or stockings
A pharmacist may also suggest you see a GP.
### 
Non-urgent advice: See a GP if:
* the pain is affecting your daily life
* lots of bumps and patches start appearing
* the bumps do not go away
## Treatment from a GP
A GP should be able to tell if you have erythema nodosum by looking at the bumps and patches.
If the GP thinks a medicine you've been taking might be causing erythema nodosum, you may be advised to stop taking it. Do not stop taking your medicines without asking a GP first.
The GP might arrange some tests if erythema nodosum:
* could be a sign of something more serious
* has not cleared within 8 weeks
