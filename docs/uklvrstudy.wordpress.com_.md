### **The UKLVR study**
An observational study comparing the effectiveness of lung volume reduction techniques for COPD. Data will be collected including baseline parameters (lung function, symptoms, and exercise capacity), response to treatment and complications. Data from consenting patients will be collected both retrospectively from 1/01/14 and prospectively. Consent will allow tracking of health resource utilisation and survival via HSCIC. The electronic database used to capture this data has been developed using the same framework employed by The British Thoracic Society audit system.
