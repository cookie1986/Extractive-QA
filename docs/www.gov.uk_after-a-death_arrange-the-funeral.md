 Arrange the funeral
The funeral can usually only take place after the death is registered. You can pay for a funeral director to arrange the funeral or do it yourself.
You should check if the person who died had made arrangements for their funeral - this could include prepaid funeral plans or life insurance.
## Funeral directors
If you hire a funeral director, choose a funeral director who’s a member of either:
* [National Association of Funeral Directors](https://www.funeral-directory.co.uk/)
* [The National Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors (SAIF)](http://www.saif.org.uk/members-search/)
These organisations have codes of practice - they should give you a price list when asked.
Some [local councils run their own funeral services](/find-local-council), for example for non-religious burials. The [British Humanist Association](http://humanism.org.uk/ceremonies/non-religious-funerals) and [Institute of Civil Funerals](http://www.iocf.org.uk/) can also help with non-religious funerals.
## Arranging the funeral yourself
Contact the Cemeteries and Crematorium Department of your local council to arrange a funeral yourself.
## Funeral costs
Funeral costs can include:
* funeral director fees
* things the funeral director pays for on your behalf (called ‘disbursements’ or ‘third-party costs’), for example crematorium or cemetery fees, or a newspaper announcement about the death
* local authority burial or cremation fees
Funeral directors may list all these costs in their quote. You can get quotes from several funeral directors to see what is available within your budget.
MoneyHelper has [information about funeral costs and how to reduce them](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/family-and-care/death-and-bereavement/how-much-does-a-funeral-cost).
### Paying for a funeral
The funeral can be paid for:
* from a financial scheme the person had, for example a pre-paid funeral plan or insurance policy
* by you, or other family members or friends
* with money from the person’s estate (savings, for example) - getting access to this is called applying for a ‘grant of representation’ (sometimes called [‘applying for probate’](/wills-probate-inheritance/applying-for-a-grant-of-representation))
You can apply for a [Funeral Expenses Payment](/funeral-payments) if you have difficulty paying for the funeral.
## Moving a body for a funeral abroad
You need permission from a coroner to move a body for a funeral abroad. Apply at least 4 days before you want the body to be moved.
Find a local coroner using the [Coroners’ Society of England and Wales website](https://www.coronersociety.org.uk/).
There is a different process for:
* [moving a body abroad from Scotland](https://www.copfs.gov.uk/contact/)
* [moving a body abroad from Northern Ireland](https://www.justice-ni.gov.uk/articles/coroners-service-northern-ireland)

Check what to do if: 
	* [the death has been reported to a coroner](/after-a-death/when-a-death-is-reported-to-a-coroner?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	* [the death happened outside the UK](/after-a-death/death-abroad?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	* [you're registering a stillbirth](/register-stillbirth?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	* [someone is missing and you think they're dead](/get-declaration-presumed-death?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
To stop or change benefits payments you can tell the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) about the death straight away.

	2. [Find bereavement services from your local council](/find-bereavement-services-from-council?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	3. [Get help paying for a funeral](/funeral-payments?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	4. [Get help paying for a child's funeral](/child-funeral-costs?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)

3. ### 
Step 3:
 Tell government about the death
 
The Tell Us Once service allows you to inform all the relevant government departments when someone dies.
	1. [Use the Tell Us Once service to tell government](/after-a-death/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	2. [If you cannot use Tell Us Once, tell government yourself](/after-a-death/tax-benefits-vehicles?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
You'll also need to tell banks, utility companies, and landlords or housing associations yourself.
4. ### 
Step 4:
 Check if you can get bereavement benefits
 
You might be eligible for financial help. 
Check if you can get:
	* [Bereavement Support Payment if your partner has died](/bereavement-support-payment?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	* [Guardian's Allowance if you're bringing up a child whose parents have died](/guardians-allowance?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
5. ### 
 and
 
 Deal with your own benefits, pension and taxes
 
Your tax, benefit claims and pension might change depending on your relationship with the person who died.
	1. [Manage your tax, pensions and benefits if your partner has died](/death-spouse-benefits-tax-pension?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	2. [Check how benefits are affected if a child dies](/after-a-death/if-a-child-or-baby-dies?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
6. ### 
 and
 
 Check if you need to apply to stay in the UK
 
If your right to live in the UK depends on your relationship with someone who died you might need to apply for a new visa.
Check the rules if:
	* [you're in the UK as the partner of a British Citizen or someone with indefinite leave to remain](/visas-partner-dies?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	* [your partner who died served as a member of HM Forces](/government/publications/hm-forces-partners-and-children?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	1. [Contact UKVI to check the rules for other visas](https://www.gov.uk/contact-ukvi-inside-outside-uk)
7. ### 
Step 5:
 Value the estate and check if you need to pay Inheritance Tax
 
To find out if there’s Inheritance Tax to pay, you need to estimate the value of the property, money and possessions (the ‘estate’) of the person who died.
	1. [Estimate the value of the estate to find out if you need to pay Inheritance Tax](/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	1. [Find out how to report the value of the estate](/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died/check-type-of-estate?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	1. [Pay Inheritance Tax if it’s due](/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died/inheritance-tax-to-pay?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
8. ### 
Step 6:
 Apply for probate
 
You might need to apply for probate before you can deal with the property, money and possessions (the ‘estate’) of the person who died.
	1. [Check if you need to apply for probate](/applying-for-probate?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	1. [Apply for probate](/applying-for-probate/apply-for-probate?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
9. ### 
Step 7:
 Deal with the estate
 
Pay any debts or taxes owed by the person who's died. You can then distribute the estate as set out in the will or the law. 
	1. [Deal with the estate](/probate-estate?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
	1. [Update property records](/update-property-records-someone-dies?step-by-step-nav=4f1fe77d-f43b-4581-baf9-e2600e2a2b7a)
