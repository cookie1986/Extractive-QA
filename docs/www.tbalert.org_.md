The GBP1 billion over 3 years pledge ([@FCDOGovUK](http://twitter.com/FCDOGovUK)) is a 30% cut, meanwhile other G7 countries have increased by 30%. Disappointing and, ultimately, tragic., Nov 16
* It a moral imperative to treat vulnerable people seeking asylum well - it is also in our interests. Cramped, unventilated and unsanitary conditions allow infectious diseases to take hold. Infections which, like TB, know no borders and can affect anyone: <https://t.co/htHVkNrM3t>, Oct 31
* We predicted this at the beginning of the pandemic and sadly it has come to pass. TB is an age old pandemic that continues to cost millions of lives annually. <https://t.co/3G5BtdTQ6F>, Oct 28
* TB Alert sends a huge thanks to Jonny and Varry Lavin who together have scaled enormous heights in the last few years. These began with Varry conquering TB and peaked when Jonny reached the summit of Mount Kilimajaro, at the culmination of a massive fundraising effort. <https://t.co/PPfrIrK5QP>
