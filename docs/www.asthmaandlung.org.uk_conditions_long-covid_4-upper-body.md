# 4. Upper body
In this video, we will guide you through some exercises to help strengthen your upper body. This involves using your hands, arms, and shoulders.
Our upper body video has three different levels of exercise: one being the least movement, and three being the most movement. Pick the level that’s right for you.
It’s normal to feel a little bit tired after exercising. However, some people with Long COVID find that they feel very tired for a few hours or days after doing exercise and are unable to do their usual everyday activities.
This is called [post-exertional malaise (PEM)](https://longcovid.physio/post-exertional-malaise) and is common in people living with the effects of Long COVID. To avoid PEM, you should build up slowly and work at the right level for you. If you do feel very tired, this is a sign that you have done too much. Next time, slow down and move down a level, or stop completely and rest.
Don’t push yourself to do too much, too soon. Your body needs rest to recover and pushing yourself too much will not speed up your recovery, instead it will set you back. Listen to your body and work at a level that is appropriate for you.
> ### Stop exercising if you get any sudden unpleasant symptoms, such as:
> 
> 
> * chest pain or tightness that’s new for you
> * feeling dizzy, nauseous, clammy or cold
> * feeling increasingly wheezy
> * general extreme fatigue
> * weakness in an arm or leg that is more than just a tired muscle.
> 
> Get advice from your GP or another health care professional if you experience any of these symptoms.
> 
> 
> 
**Call 999 if you or someone you’re with:**
* has severe chest pain
* is coughing up blood
* cannot speak due to difficulty breathing
* has lost consciousness.
It’s important to practice these exercises regularly, as this will help build your physical strength.
Make sure you've watched the [introduction video](/conditions/long-covid/1-introduction-movement "1. Introduction to movement") before starting your exercise.
