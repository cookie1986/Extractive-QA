Jointly app for carers
# Jointly app for carers
**Developed by Carers UK, Jointly is an innovative mobile and online app that is designed by carers for carers.**
Scroll down
Jointly makes caring easier, less stressful and more organised by making communication and coordination between those who share the care as easy as a text message.

## What carers tell us
> Looking after someone can be so complicated. Jointly helps me stay on top of things and share information easily with everyone involved in my son’s care."
> I think it's a great idea as we use self-directed support and this app is a great way of sharing information with the people I choose. What if something happens to me? Then everything being in my head is no good to anyone. This app will enable me to keep everyone in the loop. Thank you!"
> I'm a junior doctor who has just started using your excellent app for the care of my grandfather, and it's been a really useful tool."
 
 
## How does Jointly work?
With Jointly you can create a circle of care for the person you are looking after. Once you have set up your Jointly circle you can start using Jointly to organise care.
You can use it on your own or you can invite other people to join you and share the care.
Jointly works on iPhone, iPad, Android devices and on most modern web browsers (home computers, laptops, smartphones, tablets, etc).
 
### **Simple, intuitive group communication**
Communicate with everyone in your Jointly circle at a touch of a button! Simply post a message or upload an image.
 
### **Notes**
Keep all your notes together - and never lose them again! Create a health log or store bills using text or image entries.
 
### **Tasks/lists**
Keep organised and on top of things by using tasks and task lists. Simply create a task and assign it to any member of your Jointly circle, including yourself, and monitor its status.
 
### **Calendar**
Create date/time specific events and invite anyone in your circle. You can also use the field provided to invite people outside your Jointly circle.
 
### **Profile page**
Store useful information about the person you are looking after and have it available to access any time at a click of a button!
 
### **Medications**
Use Jointly's Medications feature to keep track of current and past medication of the person you are caring for. You can also upload an image to quickly recognise a medicine.
 
### **Contacts list**
Jointly allows you to store more useful contacts so that you can access their details anytime, anywhere!
 
 
## How to get Jointly
Jointly is available to download as a mobile app from Apple and Google Play stores. Available online at [www.jointlyapp.com](https://www.jointlyapp.com)
Jointly works with circles of care. You can purchase a Jointly circle with an one-off payment of £2.99 either through the Apple or Google Play stores or at the Jointly website.
Once you have purchased a Jointly circle for the person you are looking after you can invite as many people as you want to share the care with you. There is no additional cost for you or the people you invite to join you. Alternatively, you can use Jointly on your own to organise the care around someone. In this case you will still need to buy a Jointly circle.
