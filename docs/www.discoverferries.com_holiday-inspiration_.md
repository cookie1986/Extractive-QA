If you’re the kind of person who thinks the best holidays are those where your bicycle comes with you, then travelling by ferry makes it easy, either cycle directly up to the ferry or attach it to your car, usually at no additional cost.

 ![](https://www.discoverferries.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1794d2317cbd8774389f8c028807977c.jpg)If you are in that third of people who own a dog in the UK then going on holiday presents an additional consideration – where to go that you know will be dog-friendly and easy to get to. Ferries have a range of options to bring your pets: from onboard pet lounges, kennels, and pet-friendly cabins to keeping your pet in the familiar surroundings of your own vehicle.
The British islands below all offer pet-friendly accommodation and a mix of stunning coastal or countryside and hill walks, with the local pub being a great option for pet-friendly dining, without the need to visit the vet for an Animal Health Certificate.

   Best for beach holidays
 ![](https://www.discoverferries.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/VJ_Jersey_Hot-103.jpg)Whether you want to just chill out, feel the sun on your skin listening to the ebb and flow of the sea while reading a book, go body-boarding in the waves, snorkel in the clear blue water, build the biggest sand castle on the beach or hunt for dinosaur fossils, the best beaches are a stone-throw away from the ferry. Luckily there’s plenty of room to bring your bucket and spade.
