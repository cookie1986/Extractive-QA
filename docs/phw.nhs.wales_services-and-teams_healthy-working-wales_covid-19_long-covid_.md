 Long COVID

##### **COVID‑19 or post‑COVID‑19 syndrome**
**Use the following clinical case definitions to identify and diagnose the long-term effects of COVID-19:**
**Acute COVID-19**
Signs and symptoms of COVID‑19 for up to 4 weeks.
**Ongoing symptomatic COVID-19**
Signs and symptoms of COVID‑19 from 4 weeks up to 12 weeks.
**Post-COVID-19 syndrome** 
Signs and symptoms that develop during or after an infection consistent with COVID‑19, continue for more than 12 weeks and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis. It usually presents with clusters of symptoms, often overlapping, which can fluctuate and change over time and can affect any system in the body. Post‑COVID‑19 syndrome may be considered before 12 weeks while the possibility of an alternative underlying disease is also being assessed.
In addition to the clinical case definitions, the term ‘**long COVID**’ is commonly used to describe signs and symptoms that continue or develop after acute COVID‑19. It includes both ongoing symptomatic COVID‑19 (from 4 to 12 weeks) and post‑COVID‑19 syndrome (12 weeks or more).
**The [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng188/chapter/Recommendations) 2021*.***
##### **COVID-19 Recovery**
Recovery from Coronavirus can vary greatly from person to person. For some people recovery is short. For others, symptoms can last for weeks or even months.
It is common to feel tired and fatigued, and other symptoms can include breathlessness, cough, muscle weakness and problems with memory or concentration. This can make usual day-to-day activities more difficult. Symptoms can also “come and go” so you may feel better one day, and worse the next. Therefore it is important not to rush back to “normal” life.
Everyone is affected differently, which means you may need different care and support from others who have had it. It is important not to compare yourself to other people.

##### **Your COVID Recovery Programme**
Your COVID Recovery is an online recovery programme to help support people after COVID-19. It is has been developed by NHS England. You can search for your symptoms and find information and advice. The information can also be downloaded and printed.
You can go straight to the website**[here](https://www.yourcovidrecovery.nhs.uk/ "here")**.
##### **Local Health Board services**
Each Health Board across Wales has set up services to help individuals affected by long COVID.  This **[Welsh Government advice page](https://gov.wales/getting-support-recovery-covid-19-long-covid)** provides details of links to each Health Board in one place.
In order to find out which Health Board you live in, **[this page](https://gov.wales/nhs-wales-health-boards-and-trusts)** provides a list of which local authority areas fall within each Health Board.
##### **NHS long COVID Recovery App**
**Long COVID recovery App**
The NHS Wales Respiratory Health Group has developed this long COVID Recovery App on behalf of Welsh Government as part of the wider support available for people experiencing the longer-term effects of COVID-19. Users are able to record their symptoms, track their progress and learn to manage their condition at home with the support provided. It includes advice from therapists, psychologists, dietitians and consultants. It offers a bespoke tool and personal coach to help individuals on the road to recovery, providing a clear rehabilitation pathway.
