## Taking care of your feelings
Being diagnosed with mesothelioma can be frightening and it’s normal to feel overwhelmed. You might feel shock, fear, disbelief, anger, loneliness or resentment. You might feel a mix of these emotions. Sometimes it can be hard to accept that you have cancer and you might feel like you just want to be left alone.
It’s also a difficult time for your friends and family, who might be experiencing many of the same emotions.
When you’re ready, it’s important to talk about your feelings. You may find it helpful to talk to friends and family. You can also talk with your cancer nurse specialist. If you need more support, your cancer nurse specialist can help you find a counsellor or psychologist. Some GP practices have a counsellor as part of their team. 
> I get immense support from my family, friends and old colleagues. My consultant is fantastic, and I have a close relationship with my mesothelioma nurse, who is always there to comfort and support me. I also get a lot of love from the support group I attend. We normally meet monthly, where we have guest speakers covering issues relevant to our condition. We also have outings and other speakers about topics of interest away from mesothelioma.Sandra
