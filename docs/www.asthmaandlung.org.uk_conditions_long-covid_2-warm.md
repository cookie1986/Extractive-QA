# 2. Warm up
Try to warm up for 5-10 minutes. The aim is to gently move your joints and gradually raise your heart rate to increase the blood flow to your heart, lungs, and muscles.
Our warm up video has three different levels of exercise, one being the least movement, and three being the most movement. Pick the level that’s right for you.
You can pause the videos at any time if you are watching as you do the exercises. It’s also a good idea to have a timer ready for some of the exercises – you could use your phone or a cooking timer.
