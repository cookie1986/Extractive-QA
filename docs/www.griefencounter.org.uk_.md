## Esther's Story
“For me, grief is like standing looking across a swimming pool. Grief Encounter has been like a pair of arm bands to get across the pool. I can swim now and so I don’t need arm bands anymore and one day I might be able to get out of the pool.”
Esther was 4 when her best friend died in the Grenfell tragedy and received play therapy from Grief Encounter as part of her bereavement support.
