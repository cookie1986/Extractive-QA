## Understanding sleep problems and insomnia
We all have evenings when we find it hard to fall asleep or find ourselves waking up in the night. How we sleep and how much sleep we need is different for all of us, and it often changes as we get older.
Sleep problems usually sort themselves out within about a month. But longer stretches of bad sleep can start to affect our lives. Poor sleep can cause extreme tiredness and make usually manageable tasks harder.
If you regularly have problems sleeping, you may be experiencing [insomnia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/insomnia/). Insomnia can last for months or even years, but usually improves if you change your sleeping habits.
Sleep problems are common, and the tips on this page should improve your sleep hygiene and help you create a daily sleep routine.
But if nothing helps you to sleep better, or you've had sleep problems for months and tiredness is affecting your daily life in a way that makes it hard to cope, you could benefit from further support.

### 
 Keep regular sleep hours
Making a habit of going to bed when you feel tired and getting up at roughly the same time helps teach your body to sleep better. Try to avoid napping where possible.

 Confront sleeplessness
If you are lying awake unable to sleep, do not force it. Get up and do something relaxing for a bit, and return to bed when you feel sleepier.

### 
 Create a restful environment

 Write down your worries
If you often lie awake worrying about tomorrow, make it a part of your daily routine before bed to write a list for the next day. This can help put your mind at rest. [Video: Tackle your worries](https://bcove.video/2lCXuEI)

### 
 Move more, sleep better
Regular exercise is good for your physical health and your mind too – and being active during the day can help you sleep better. Just remember to avoid vigorous activity near bedtime if it affects your sleep. [Better Health: Home workout videos](/better-health/get-active/home-workout-videos/)

 Put down the pick-me-ups
Caffeine and alcohol can stop you falling asleep and prevent deep sleep. Try to cut down on alcohol and avoid caffeine close to bedtime.

## Possible causes of sleep problems
There are many reasons why you might not be able to sleep well.
Some people are naturally lighter sleepers or take longer to drop off, while some life circumstances might make it more likely for your sleep to be interrupted, like stressful events or having a new baby.
There are lots of things that can influence our mental health, such as our upbringing, things that happen to us and even our temperament.
