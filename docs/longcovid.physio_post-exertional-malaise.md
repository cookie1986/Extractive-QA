## Post-Exertional Symptom Exacerbation (PESE)
When symptoms such as disabling [fatigue](/fatigue) or exhaustion, difficulty thinking, pain, exercise intolerance, and other symptoms are made worse by exertion, this is called post-exertional symptom exacerbation. Post-exertional symptom exacerbation (PESE) may also be called post-exertional malaise (PEM) or post-exertional neuroimmune exhaustion (PENE). 
Post-exertional symptom exacerbation can be triggered by physical, cognitive, mental, social or emotional exertions, and varies among different people. The worsening of symptoms by exertion can happen immediately, or can happen 24-72 hours after exertion. This can make it difficult to predict or manage. It can take days, weeks or even months to recover from post-exertional symptom exacerbation. The exhaustion caused by exertion can be very disabling, as it can affect different symptoms or parts of the body. Post-exertional symptom exacerbation is a feature of the inability to produce sufficient energy on demand, and is characteristic among those with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). 
[ME/CFS South Australia Inc](https://mecfssa.org.au/resources/post-exertional-malaise-pem) provides a comprehensive description of what is post-exertional malaise, assessment, and management. Dialogues ME/CFS provides accessible videos on post-exertion malaise, available below. 
[Access Videos](https://www.dialogues-mecfs.co.uk/films/post-exertional-malaise/) 
ME Action and Patient-Led Research Collaborative provide a [pacing and management guide](https://www.meaction.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Pacing-Guide-Clincians.FINAL2_.pdf) that explains post-exertional symptom exacerbation to help better understand the common features and science. 
Post-exertional malaise is a cardinal symptom of ME/CFS within [international consensus criteria](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2796.2011.02428.x). It has wide diversity in presentation and attempts have been made to [characterise](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2020.01025/full) post-exertional malaise. The ME Association provides a [summary review](https://meassociation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/MEA-Research-Review-Assessing-PEM-in-MECFS-25.03.19.pdf) of post-exertional malaise. The Workwell Foundation describes the immediate, short-term and long-term time course of post-exertional malaise in a [factsheet](https://workwellfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/WW-PEM-Timecourse.pdf). Below is a 3 minute video about post-exertion malaise and ME.

Some people living with Long COVID [report](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.24.20248802v2.full.pdf) post-exertional symptom exacerbation, and [lessons](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2020.606824/full) can be shared in different and additional directions between Long COVID and ME/CFS. Tools are available to [assess](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/9/1/26) post-exertional malaise, such as the [DePaul Symptom Questionnaire](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fped.2018.00330/full), available in original, adapted, brief (short-form), paediatric, and paediatric screener versions. The [short-form](https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Frep0000285) version is available [here](https://redcap.is.depaul.edu/surveys/?s=HCT7J8EWPC). 
There is no [one-size-fits-all approach](https://www.jospt.org/do/10.2519/jospt.blog.20220202/full/) to managing PESE. Identification of the top three symptoms, how much activity is necessary to provoke PESE, how long symptoms of PESE last, and how they change over time are [critical to inform approaches to PESE management](https://www.jospt.org/do/10.2519/jospt.blog.20220202/full/). The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides a[guide](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/pdfs/interagency/Managing-PEM_508.pdf) to managing PESE.
Exercise intolerance observed in Long COVID is [not physical deconditioning](https://cdn.publisher.gn1.link/jornaldepneumologia.com.br/pdf/2021_47_5_3604_english.pdf) and clearly [PESE is not deconditioning](https://www.jospt.org/do/10.2519/jospt.blog.20220209), because evidence from systems-level physiology indicates important differences in physiological responses to acute exercise between people with deconditioning compared to people with PESE. It is [unacceptable to be simplistic](https://cdn.publisher.gn1.link/jornaldepneumologia.com.br/pdf/2021_47_5_3604_english.pdf) when attempting to unravel the post-COVID-19 syndrome exercise intolerance mechanisms.

A [brief questionnaire](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6165517/), which includes questions from the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire, may be useful to screen for post-exertional symptom exacerbation among people living with Long COVID. The first step (images below) includes 5 questions to assess the frequency and severity of post-exertional malaise over the past 6 months. The second step (images below) includes 5 questions to examine duration of symptom exacerbation after activity, recovery time, and role of exercise in symptom exacerbation. 
The new [DePaul Post-Exertional Malaise Questionnaire](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1359105318805819?rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&url_ver=Z39.88-2003) is also available to assess key characteristics, triggers, onset, duration, and effects of pacing. Access this tool [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1359105318805819).
