It is responsible for making laws on transferred matters in Northern Ireland and for scrutinising the work of Ministers and Government Departments. The Assembly sits at Parliament Buildings, Stormont Estate, Belfast. Members (MLAs) meet to debate issues; question Ministers; and make laws for the benefit of people in Northern Ireland. Each MLA represents her or his constituency, and there are 5 MLAs for each of the 18 constituencies.**Assembly Chamber**The Assembly Chamber is where [Plenary](#GlossaryPlenary "Find out more about Plenaries") sessions are held.

It may, on occasion, be necessary for the Assembly to meet in Plenary in addition to the normal schedule.**Assembly Commission**The Northern Ireland Assembly Commission is the corporate body of the Northern Ireland Assembly. It has the responsibility, under section 40(4) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, to provide the Assembly with the property, staff and services required for the Assembly to carry out its work. The Assembly Commission may delegate any of its functions to the Speaker or a member of staff of the Assembly and may determine its own procedures.**Assembly Committees**There are 2 main types of Assembly Committee – [Statutory Committees](#GlossaryStatCmte "Find out more about Statutory Committees") and [Standing Committees](#GlossaryStandingCmte "Find out more about Standing Committees"). Committees examine proposed new laws and make suggestions for amendments, review the work of Ministers and their Departments and discuss issues relating to the work of the Assembly. Each Assembly committee specialises in a particular area of work and has a membership of 11 MLAs, except for the Audit Committee that has a membership of 5 MLAs. Assembly committees have met with hundreds of people and considered many different issues that affect the people of Northern Ireland. Examples of these include health issues, water charges, school transfer tests, energy prices, road safety and access to housing. Committees usually meet on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.**Assembly Consent Motion**An Assembly Consent Motion is a mechanism for the Assembly to provide its consent for a decision. ACMs are normally used when a Department wishes to set up or dismantle an arm’s-length body.

**Devolved Matters**
Devolved Matters are those that the Northern Ireland Assembly has been given the power, under devolution, to make decisions/laws on.
**Division**

**Private Members' Business**
Each sitting day, a certain amount of time is set aside for Private Members’ Business, that is, for the consideration of bills and motions put forward by Private Members. **Private Members’ Motions** can relate to virtually any subject that Members care to raise. It gives our elected representatives (MLAs) the chance to bring to the Assembly for debate, issues that are of particular interest to them. The relevant Minister may be present at the time of the debate to answer questions. MLAs will debate the motion and then take a vote on whether they agree or disagree with the motion. This item of business gives our MLAs the opportunity to inform Ministers how they feel about particular issues, but it is for the Minister to decide whether or not to take action.
[Back to the top ^](#GlossaryTop "Back to the top of the page")
## Q
**Questions for Answer**
The purpose of Assembly Questions is to ask for information or to press for action. When the Assembly is in session, Members may table up to five questions for written answer each day, one of which may be for priority answer within two to five working days. Non priority questions should receive a written answer within ten working days. Members who wish to ask an oral question of a Minister submit their names for inclusion in a computer ballot each Tuesday and, if selected, they table their question by Thursday of that week.
**Questions for Urgent Oral Answer**
A Question for Urgent Oral Answer is a special type of oral question which it is not already on the oral list of questions for answering that Monday or Tuesday. It is the Speaker’s decision to accept or not the Urgent Question. The matter must be of an urgent nature and of public importance.
**Questions for Written Answer**
Five written questions are allowed per Member per day. They must be tabled (submitted to the Business Office) by 4pm each day. Members may ask any question as long as it relates to the Minister’s remit. A list of tabled questions is published the following day; Questions are normally scheduled for answer 10 working days following their publication.
**Question Time**
Question Time takes place during Plenary each Monday and Tuesday between 2.00pm – 3.30pm. It is an opportunity for Members to question Ministers on the work of their Departments. There are two Ministerial slots during each Question Time. The First Minister and the deputy First Minister are up for oral questions every other week. All other Ministers and the Northern Ireland Assembly Commission, the body that manages the work of the Assembly, are allocated slots in alphabetical order (according to the Departmental name).
**Quorum (Plenary Session)**
Quorum is the minimum number of MLAs required to be in the Assembly Chamber during Plenary sessions. The quorum during Plenary sessions is ten members, including the Speaker. If a quorum is not present, the Speaker will call for the division bells to be rung. If, after five minutes, a quorum is still not present, the Speaker will either suspend the Assembly to a later time; or adjourn the Assembly until the next sitting day.
[Back to the top ^](#GlossaryTop "Back to the top of the page")
## R
**Recall**
The Assembly can be recalled during periods of recess by either a motion to recall signed by 30 Members, or at the request of the First Minister and deputy First Minister.
**Recess**
Recess is a period of time when the Northern Ireland Assembly is not in session i.e. no Plenary sittings or Committee meetings take place. Recess periods generally occur during the summer months and at Halloween, Christmas and Easter. During recess, MLAs can spend more time in their constituencies, meeting with local people and plan how to bring issues of concern to the Assembly. It is also a chance for them to examine forthcoming legislation from other MLAs and Departments. The Business Committee determines the dates for recess in accordance with Standing Order 10 (9). [Standing Orders](#SOs "Link to the definition of Standing Orders") are a set of rules which regulate the way the Northern Ireland Assembly carries out its business. Although committees do not normally meet during recess, they can do so if they feel it is appropriate.
**Register of Members' Interests**
The Register of Members' Interests provides information of any financial interest or other material benefit that a Member has received which might reasonably be thought by others to influence his or her actions, speeches or votes in the Assembly, or actions taken in his or her capacity as an MLA. Members are responsible for updating their own entries in the register. The Register is published on the Assembly website and is updated regularly.
**Reserved Matters**
Matters concerning Northern Ireland that the UK Parliament still has the power to make laws about.
[Back to the top ^](#GlossaryTop "Back to the top of the page")
## S
**Standing Committees**
There are 6 Standing Committees (permanent committees). With specific roles assigned to them from Standing Orders:
* Business Committee
* Audit Committee
* Public Accounts
* Procedures Committee
* Standards and Privileges
* Assembly and Executive Review
**Standing Orders**
These are the rules that govern the legislative operation of the Assembly. These rules can be changed by the Committee on Procedures. [You can read the latest version of the Assembly's Standing Orders by following this link.](/assembly-business/standing-orders/ "You can read the latest version of the Assembly's Standing Orders by following this link.")
**Statutory Committees**
Each Department has a (Statutory) Committee that examines the work of the Minister and the Department. There are 9 Statutory Committees.
**Statuory Rules**
Statutory Rules can also be referred to as subordinate or secondary legislation and are made to provide the detail and procedures of an Act. There are four kinds of Assembly procedure a statutory rule can be subject to, which is determined by the parent legislation, namely:
* **affirmative resolution -** the statutory rule is made by the department and laid in the Assembly but cannot come into operation until the Minister has brought forward a motion in the Assembly and the motion is agreed by the Members; or
* **negative resolution -** the statutory rule is made by the department, laid before the Assembly and will become law unless it is prayed against (motion for its annulment moved by Committee Chairperson or any Member) within the statutory period (10 days on which the Assembly has sat or 30 days, whichever is the longer). Note: this is by far the most common Assembly procedure for statutory rules;
* **confirmatory procedure -** the statutory rule is made by the department and laid before the Assembly but will not have effect, unless a motion is moved by the Minister, and agreed by Members within (usually) 6 months of the statutory rule’s coming into operation. Note: this procedure is most commonly used for some social security statutory rules and for some statutory rules made under employment legislation.
* **draft statutory rule subject to approval –** for a draft statutory rule (where the parent legislation states that it must be approved in draft by resolution of the Assembly before it is made) a motion will be moved by the Minister in the Assembly in relation to the draft rule and if agreed by Members the statutory rule can then be made by the department.
Every statutory rule which is laid before the Assembly and which is subject to proceedings in the Assembly is referred to the appropriate Committee for consideration. To assist the Committees with their consideration, the Northern Ireland Assembly has appointed an Examiner of Statutory Rules who provides the technical scrutiny of the rules and reports to the Assembly and its Committees on the findings.

## W
**Whips**
Whips are MLAs in each party who are responsible for keeping party members informed about Assembly business. They also make sure MLAs attend the Chamber, especially when there is a vote. Whips try to ensure that MLAs vote in line with their party’s policies
