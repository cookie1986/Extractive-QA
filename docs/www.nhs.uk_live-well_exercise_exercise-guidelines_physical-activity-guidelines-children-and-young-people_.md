 Physical activity guidelines for children and young people
**How much physical activity should children and young people aged 5 to 18 do to keep healthy?**
Children and young people need to do 2 types of physical activity each week:
* aerobic exercise
* exercises to strengthen their muscles and bones
Children and young people aged 5 to 18 should:
* aim for an average of at least 60 minutes of moderate or vigorous intensity physical activity a day across the week
* take part in a variety of types and intensities of physical activity across the week to develop movement skills, muscles and bones
* reduce the time spent sitting or lying down and break up long periods of not moving with some activity. Aim to spread activity throughout the day
## What counts as moderate activity?
Moderate intensity activities will raise your heart rate, and make you breathe faster and feel warmer.
One way to tell if you're working at a moderate intensity level is if you can still talk, but not sing.
Children and young people should do a range of different activities across the week.
Examples include:
* walking to school or walking the dog
* playground activities, including jumping, running and catching
* physical education
* sports, like football or tennis
* swimming
* skipping
* dancing
* skateboarding or rollerblading
* cycling
## What activities strengthen muscles and bones?
Examples include:
* gymnastics
* football
* jumping
* martial arts
* resistance exercises with exercise bands, weight machines or handheld weights
* sit-ups, press-ups and other similar exercises
