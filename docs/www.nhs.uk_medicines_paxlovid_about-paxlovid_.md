 About Paxlovid
Paxlovid is an antiviral medicine that works by stopping the virus that causes coronavirus (COVID-19) from growing and spreading in the body.
It's used to treat early COVID-19 infection and help to prevent more severe symptoms.
Paxlovid is a combination of 2 medicines called nirmatrelvir and ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir stops the virus from growing and spreading, and ritonavir helps nirmatrelvir from being broken down in your body long enough to do its job.
Paxlovid is only available on prescription. However, you will only be eligible to have the medicine if you're in the [highest risk group](/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-care-and-treatments-for-coronavirus/treatments-for-coronavirus/).
If you are in the highest risk group you may be sent a letter and a lateral flow test that you can do at home. This is in case you develop symptoms of COVID-19.
If you test positive for COVID-19 and are eligible, you will usually be contacted by the NHS within 24 hours of your positive test result. If you have not been contacted within 24 hours of your positive test but you are eligible for COVID-19 treatments, call your GP surgery or specialist, or [call 111](tel:111). They can make an urgent referral if needed.
You will then be assessed (over the phone) to see if Paxlovid is right for you. If it's suitable, they'll tell you how you will get your medicine. It may be sent to you at home, or it can also be collected by someone else such as a friend, relative or NHS volunteer responder.
Paxlovid comes as tablets. You'll need to start taking them as soon as possible after you have tested positive for COVID-19 and within 5 days (or 7 days, if advised by a health professional) of your symptoms starting.
