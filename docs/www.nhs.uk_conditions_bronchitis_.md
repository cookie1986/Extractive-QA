# Bronchitis
**Bronchitis is inflammation of the airways in the lungs that is usually caused by an infection. It often gets better without treatment in around 3 weeks.**
Some people have long-term inflammation of the airways in the lungs called chronic bronchitis. This is known as [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).](/conditions/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd/)
## Check if you have bronchitis
Symptoms of bronchitis can be similar to a cold or flu.
Symptoms include:
* a cough – you may cough up clear, white, yellow or green mucus
* chest pain when coughing
* shortness of breath
* a sore throat
* a runny nose
* a high temperature
## Things you can do to help with bronchitis
There are some things you can do to ease the symptoms of bronchitis and reduce the risk of spreading infections to other people.
### 
 Do
* get plenty of rest – try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you have a high temperature or do not feel well enough to do your normal activities
* drink plenty of fluids
* take painkillers like [paracetamol](/medicines/paracetamol-for-adults-old/) or [ibuprofen](/medicines/ibuprofen-for-adults/) to help with pain and bring down a high temperature
* try adding honey to a warm drink to help soothe your throat (do not give honey to babies under 1)
