# Use our free will writing service
Get started on writing or amending your will for free with our free will writing service.
## What is the free will writing service?
Our free will writing service allows you to write or update your will, and have it paid for by Asthma + Lung UK at no cost to you. This would normally cost between £90 - £150 (sometimes even more).
While you’re under no obligation to do so, most people who use the service also choose to leave a gift to Asthma + Lung UK to help us in our work to transform lung health in the UK.
## 
 Choose the approach that suits you best
There are 2 ways to write or update your will:
1. Write your will online with our partners at Beyond, the UK’s #1 online will writing service, in as little as 15 minutes from the comfort of your own home.
2. Request a free will writing pack to have a simple will written with a solicitor near you.

**Regulations**
The National Free Wills Network conforms to relevant regulations of The Law Societies of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland as well as the Charity Commission and the Institute of Fundraising.
**Disclaimer**
Any solicitor you are referred to as part of the National Free Wills Network is an independent professional from whom you will receive impartial and confidential advice. All Network solicitors are members of their relevant Law Society. Inclusion of a firm of solicitors in the Network does not imply a recommendation by Asthma + Lung UK.
