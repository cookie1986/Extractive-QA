 Risks to your child's lungs
Lung conditions can be caused by the genes your child is born with, as well as things in their environment that affect their lungs as they grow. In this information, we explain some of the early risks to your child’s lungs, the dangers of passive smoking and air pollution, as well as how you can reduce the risks to your child’s lungs.
