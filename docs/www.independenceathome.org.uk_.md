 People living at home with disability and long term illness are finding life much more challenging during the pandemic.
   
  

 When all else fails we do what we can to improve their independence and reduce isolation.

Independence at Home was founded in October 1965. Since then, we have worked steadily to help improve independence, comfort, safety, dignity and quality of life for people with long-term illness and disability.   
  

 Independence at Home is a charity that provides grants to people of all ages who have a physical or learning disability or long term illness and who are in financial need.  
  

 We may be able to help you if you, or a member of your family, have a long term illness or disability and need financial help towards the cost to improve your independence, comfort, safety and quality of life at home.   
  

 Independence at Home has a fascinating 55 year history. [Click here](documents/history-summary.pdf) to read more.
