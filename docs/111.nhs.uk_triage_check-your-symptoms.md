Check your symptoms
If you’re worried about a symptom, answer some questions and we will tell you what to do next.

You might be advised to:
* go to an urgent treatment centre or A&E
* get help from an evening and weekend GP
* contact an emergency dentist
* get urgent specialist mental health support
* look after yourself at home
