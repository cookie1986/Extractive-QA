 Excessive sleepiness and driving
Excessive sleepiness means that you have had difficulty concentrating and have found yourself falling asleep - for example while at work, watching television or when driving.
You must tell DVLA if you have:
* confirmed moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS), with excessive sleepiness
* either narcolepsy or cataplexy, or both
* any other sleep condition that has caused excessive sleepiness for at least 3 months - including suspected or confirmed mild OSAS
You must not drive until you’re free from excessive sleepiness or until your symptoms are under control and you’re strictly following any necessary treatment.
You can be fined up to £1,000 if you do not tell DVLA about a medical condition that affects your driving. You may be prosecuted if you’re involved in an accident as a result.
Ask your doctor if you’re not sure if your excessive sleepiness will affect your driving.
## Car or motorcycle licence
 [Report your condition online](https://www.driving-medical-condition.service.gov.uk/report) 
You can also [fill in form SL1](/government/publications/sl1-confidential-medical-information) and send it to DVLA. The address is on the form.
## Bus, coach or lorry licence

## Driving while tired
