## 3. What we do with your information

We may also use personal information to carry out due diligence on prospective research grant recipients.  
We also use publicly available information to research current and potential donors to understand their philanthropic interests and how we can best build and develop the relationship.  We adhere to our internal policies and procedures which are aligned to the Fundraising Regulator’s Code of Best Practice.  Donors may opt out of our research process at any time by contacting our supporter care team at [info@asthmaandlung.org.uk](mailto:info@asthmaandlung.org.uk)
## 4. The legal basis for processing your information
Under the UK GDPR and the DPA, we must have a legal reason to collect, keep and use your personal information.  We rely on the following legal basis for processing your data:
* Consent
* Legitimate Interests
We process your personal information for our legitimate interests to allow us to run, fund and evaluate Asthma and Lung UK as a charitable entity and in pursuit of our objectives.  When we process your personal information for our legitimate interests, we make sure to consider and balance any potential impact on you and your rights under data protection laws.  We will always ensure that your personal information will not be used where our interests are overridden by the impact on you.  The following are some examples of the instances where we process your data for our legitimate interests:
Direct marketing: 
We will send postal marketing and fundraising requests which further the aims and objectives of Asthma and Lung UK and don’t unduly impact the rights of the individual
Profiling and analysing information:
At Asthma + Lung UK, our vital work is only made possible thanks to the generosity of our supporters. We know how important your donation is, so we look to ensure that our fundraising efforts are as effective as they can be. We sometimes use publicly available sources to develop a better understanding of our supporters and to gain insight into their philanthropic interests. This allows us to make sure we are spending your donations effectively, by using research and analysis to inform our decisions and ensure our conversations with donors provide the best supporter experience possible
We use data which has been provided directly to Asthma and Lung UK and combine this with information from publicly available sources including but not limited to charity websites and annual reviews, corporate websites, the electoral register and Companies House in order to create a fuller understanding of someone’s interests. We only use reputable sources, where someone would expect their information may be read by the public.  
We’re committed to putting you in control of your data and you’re free at any time to opt out from this activity.  To find out more, please contact [info@asthmaandlung.org.uk](mailto:info@asthmaandlung.org.uk)
## 5. How we share information with other organisations
We are committed to protecting your information and therefore it will never be sold to external organisations and will only be disclosed to those acting as agents and data processors carrying out work on our behalf.  Where we enter into an agreement with an external party, such arrangements will be subject to a formal agreement between Asthma and Lung UK and that organisation to protect your information.  These parties may include:
* Suppliers who send out communications on our behalf
* Fulfilment organisations to process payments received as donations
* Research agencies supporting not-for-profit organisations, including database screening
* Other partners engaged in the Taskforce for Lung Health
When we work with carefully selected partners for either research, analysis or fundraising. These partners will only have access to your information when the necessary contractual arrangements have been agreed and signed, these contracts dictate our requirements for them to process the information and conform to data protection legislation
## 6. How we protect your information
We aim to ensure that there are appropriate physical, technical and managerial controls in place to protect any personal information you may provide to us, for example our online forms are always encrypted, and our network is protected and monitored.  All Asthma and Lung UK staff members are required to complete training on handling data securely.
Where we use external companies to collect or process personal information on our behalf, we carry out comprehensive checks on them before we work with them and ensure that contracts are in place that set out our expectations and requirements.  We may work with external companies that transfer personal information outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) to allow them to perform services on our behalf.  In doing so your information may be stored and processed outside of the EEA.  Where this happens, we will endeavour to ensure your information is processes in accordance with the appropriate security requirements to meet all our legal responsibilities.
Despite all our precautions no information transmission through the internet, email, the post or by telephone can ever be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  The transmission of information to us is at your own risk.
## 7. How long we keep your information
We will hold your information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity.  If you request that stop sending you materials, then we will hold a record of that request indefinitely.  All our regular communications offer you an option not to receive any further communication.
