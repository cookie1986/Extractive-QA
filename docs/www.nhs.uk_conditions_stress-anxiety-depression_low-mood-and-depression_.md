 Low mood, sadness and depression
**Most people feel low sometimes, but if it's affecting your life, there are things you can try that may help.**
Support is also available if you're finding it hard to cope with low mood, sadness or depression.
## Symptoms of a low mood
Symptoms of a general low mood may include feeling:
* sad
* anxious or panicky
* [more tired than usual](/live-well/sleep-and-tiredness/) or being unable to sleep
* angry or frustrated
* low on confidence or self-esteem
A low mood often gets better after a few days or weeks.
It's usually possible to improve a low mood by making small changes in your life. For example, resolving something that's bothering you or getting more sleep.
### Symptoms of depression
If you have a low mood that lasts 2 weeks or more, it could be a sign of [depression](/mental-health/conditions/clinical-depression/overview/).
Other symptoms of depression may include:
* not getting any enjoyment out of life
* feeling hopeless
* not being able to concentrate on everyday things
* having [suicidal thoughts](/mental-health/feelings-symptoms-behaviours/behaviours/help-for-suicidal-thoughts/) or thoughts about [harming yourself](/mental-health/feelings-symptoms-behaviours/behaviours/self-harm/getting-help/)
## Things you can try to help with a low mood
### 
 Do
* try talking about your feelings to a friend, family member, health professional or counsellor. You could also contact [Samaritans](https://www.samaritans.org/how-we-can-help/contact-samaritan/), call [116 123](Tel: 116 123) or email [jo@samaritans.org](mailto:jo@samaritans.org) if you need someone to talk to
* try the [6 ways to feel happier](/mental-health/self-help/tips-and-support/how-to-be-happier/), which are simple lifestyle changes to help you feel more in control and able to cope
* find out [how to raise your self-esteem](/mental-health/self-help/tips-and-support/raise-low-self-esteem/)
* consider peer support, where people use their experiences to help each other. [Find out more about peer support on the Mind website](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/peer-support/finding-peer-support/)
* try [mindfulness](/mental-health/self-help/tips-and-support/mindfulness/), where you focus on the present moment
* listen to [free mental wellbeing audio guides](/mental-health/self-help/guides-tools-and-activities/mental-wellbeing-audio-guides/)
### 
 Don’t
* do not try to do everything at once; set small targets that you can easily achieve
* do not focus on the things you cannot change – focus your time and energy into helping yourself feel better
* try not to tell yourself that you're alone – most people feel low sometimes and support is available
* try not to use alcohol, cigarettes, gambling or drugs to relieve a low mood. These can all contribute to poor mental health

## Where to get NHS help for a low mood
### Referring yourself for therapy
If you need more support, you can get free talking therapies like [cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)](/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/overview/) on the NHS.
You can refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service without a referral from a GP.
[Find an NHS talking therapies service](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-psychological-therapies-service/)
### 
Non-urgent advice: See a GP if:
* you've had a low mood for more than 2 weeks
* you're struggling to cope with a low mood
* things you're trying yourself are not helping
* you would prefer to get a referral from a GP
### 
Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if:
* you need help urgently, but it's not an emergency
111 can tell you the right place to get help if you need to see someone. Go to [NHS 111 online](https://111.nhs.uk/) or call 111.
### 
Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E now if:
* you or someone you know needs immediate help
* you have seriously harmed yourself – for example, by taking a drug overdose
A mental health emergency should be taken as seriously as a medical emergency.

## Causes of a low mood
There are many reasons why you might feel low at some point in your life.
Any sort of difficult event or experience could lead to sadness or low self-esteem. Sometimes it's possible to feel low without there being an obvious reason.
### Identifying the cause
If you know what's causing your low mood it might be easier to find ways to manage it.
Some examples of things that may cause a low mood include:
* work – feeling pressure at work, unemployment or retirement
* family – relationship difficulties, divorce or [caring for someone](/conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/support-and-benefits-for-carers/)
* financial problems – unexpected bills or borrowing money
* health – illness, injury or [losing someone](/mental-health/feelings-symptoms-behaviours/feelings-and-symptoms/grief-bereavement-loss/) (bereavement)
Even significant life events such as buying a house, having a baby or planning a wedding could lead to feelings of sadness.
You might find it hard to explain to people why you feel this way, but talking to someone could help you find a solution.
