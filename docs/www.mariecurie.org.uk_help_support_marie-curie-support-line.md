## We’re here for you with the support you need, when you need it
Call the Marie Curie Support Line for practical or clinical information and emotional support if you're living with or caring for someone who has a terminal illness, whatever your situation.
You don't need to have used Marie Curie services or be directly involved in a loved-one's care to call the support line. We're here to help family and friends, and you can find support on a wide range of issues. No one is turned away, so please do not hesitate calling if you need any kind of support.
