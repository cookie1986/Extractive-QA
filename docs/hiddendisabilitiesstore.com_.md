## What is the Hidden Disabilities Sunflower?
Â 
The Hidden Disabilities Sunflower is a simple tool for you to voluntarily share that you have a disability or condition that may not be immediately apparent â and that you may need a helping hand, understanding, or more time in shops, at work, on transport, or in public spaces.
### Just because you canât see it, doesnât mean it is not there
Â 
Globally 1 in 7 of us live with a disability. That is approximately 1.3 billion people.
Â 
But while some of us experience a disability that is visible, many have a non-visible condition or experience a combination of both visible and non-visible conditions. These disabilities can be temporary, situational or permanent. They can be neurological, cognitive and neurodevelopmental as well as physical, visual, auditory and include sensory and processing difficulties. They can also be respiratory as well as chronic health conditions such as arthritis and diabetes, chronic pain and sleep disorders.
Â 
### Making the invisible visible
Â 
As diverse as these conditions are, so are your individual access needs and the barriers you face in your daily life. So you can opt to wear the Sunflower to discreetly be seen in shops, at work, on transport, or in public spaces.

**The Hidden Disabilities Sunflower is part of Hidden Disabilities Sunflower Scheme Limited, a private company based in the UK.**
*The Hidden Disabilities Sunflower products are strictly not for resale by individuals, businesses or organisations - they are intended to be donated to your colleagues and customers free of charge.**Official products are only available from this website as well as from registered charities who are Sunflower Members and who have been authorised to sell the product. These charities will display an official badge and will be selling official Hidden Disabilities Sunflower products. Hidden Disabilities Sunflower products being sold on eBay or Amazon are being resold at inflated prices or are counterfeit or copycat versions which can be misleading, cause confusion by not being recognised quickly by members of the scheme and may mean wearers are not helped as intended.*
