**We want your opinion!**
Please take 3 minutes to answer a short survey about this page.
[Go to the survey](https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/TALDAccomListSurvey)
The list below shows the current accommodation sites in EU/EEA countries with which clusters of Legionnaires’ disease have been identified but where the European Legionnaires’ disease Surveillance Network (ELDSNet) is unable to assess the risk of *Legionella* infection, or where ELDSNet believe there may be increased risk to travellers. Please note this is not a complete list of clusters detected by the European Legionnaires’ disease Surveillance Network (ELDSNet).
This list will never include accommodation sites in non EU/EEA countries, since ELDSNet cannot formally verify the risk status of the accommodation sites and the actions taken in response to the clusters. 
| Accommodation name | Location | Most recent case date\* | Notes | Last updated\*\* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The Corner Duomo Hotel | Milano, Lombardia, Italy  | 25/09/2022 | An ELDSNet form A has not been received | 18/11/2022 |
| Gennarino | Livorno, Toscana, Italy | 04/07/2022 | An ELDSNet form B was received reporting that control measures were unsatisfactory | 06/10/2022 |
| Terme Oriente | Ischia Porto, Campania, Italy | 27/10/2022 | An ELDSNet form B was received reporting that control measures were unsatisfactory. | 31/01/2023 |
| Mareco Resort | Forio d’Ischia, Campania, Italy | 30/06/2022 | An ELDSNet form B was received reporting that control measures were unsatisfactory. | 24/08/2022 |
| Lake & Nature Hotel Gloria | Molveno, Trentino Alto Adige, Italy | 16/07/2021 | An ELDSNet form B was received reporting that control measures were unsatisfactory. | 27/09/2021 |
*\* Most recent date of disease onset among Legionnaires’ disease cases reported to have stayed at this accommodation site*
*\*\* Depending on the accommodation site history, this could refer to: 1. Date of publication of the site; OR 2. Date of the most recent case notification; OR 3. Date of the most recent form B received.*

 European Legionnaires’ Disease Surveillance Network (ELDSNet) - Operating procedures](/en/publications-data/european-legionnaires-disease-surveillance-network-eldsnet-operating-procedures)
 This document explains the operating procedures of the European Legionnaires’ Disease Surveillance Network, coordinated by ECDC. It specifically relates to reporting cases of travel-associated Legionnaires’ disease arising from stays in hotel or other commercial holiday accommodation. The aim is to quickly identify and control outbreaks of the disease and minimise the risk to holidaymakers. This edition supersedes the January 2012 edition.
