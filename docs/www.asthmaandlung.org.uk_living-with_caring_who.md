# Who is a carer?
You’re a carer if you give unpaid care to someone who couldn’t manage without this help. 
Anyone can become a carer. You may feel helping someone who is close to you is part and parcel of life. You may not think of yourself – or want to think of yourself – as a carer.
Caring for someone can happen gradually over time, or it can happen very quickly. The help you provide as a carer is very important. It can bring many rewards, but also challenges. 
## What does a carer do?
Every caring situation is unique. You might: 
* **do everyday jobs around the house** – such as cleaning, cooking, or washing
* **give personal care** – by helping with washing and dressing, medication, and eating
* **provide emotional support** – by being there for them and lending a friendly ear
* **help with admin and finances** – such as reading or writing letters and paying bills.
It may also involve taking the person you care for to doctors’ appointments or pulmonary rehabilitation sessions. You may even provide support by encouraging the person you care for to keep active and help them socialise.
