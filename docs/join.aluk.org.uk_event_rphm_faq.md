### How much do I have to raise?
 
When you sign up you’ll pledge to raise £350 to support our vital work. That could be enough to fund three whole days of lifesaving research!

The money raised by taking part in the Royal Parks Half Marathon will help us to continue to fight for lung health. We do this by funding world-leading research to help change millions of lives, providing services that support thousands of people across the country and leading campaigns that help make lasting change.
