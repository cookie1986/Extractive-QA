## Cost of living payments
In England, Scotland, and Wales the government is offering payments to help with the cost of living crisis. You could get: 
* £301 if you are on an eligible low income benefit, to be paid during spring 2023
* £150 if you are on an eligible disability benefit, to be paid during summer 2023
* £300 if you are on an eligible low income benefit, to be paid during autumn 2023
* £299 if you are on an eligible low income benefit, to be paid in spring 2024.
These payments will not affect the benefits or tax credits you get. The government has [the most up to date guidance about cost of living payments](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cost-of-living-payment#cost-of-living-payments-2023-to-2024). 
Find out [more about cost of living payments in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/cost-living-payments). 
## Personal Independence Payment (PIP)
### England, Wales, and Northern Ireland
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, Personal Independence Payment (PIP) is paid to some people who have a long-term health condition or disability and are aged between 16 and state pension age.
PIP can help you with some of the extra costs if you have a long-term health condition or disability. It replaces Disability Living Allowance (DLA).
PIP is not means tested. This means that it does not depend on your income or any savings you might have.
PIP can be paid whether you are working or not. To qualify for PIP: 
* you must have had the difficulties or needs for three months before you can claim
* you must be likely to continue to have them for the next nine months.
PIP is made up of two parts: a daily living part and a mobility part. If you’re eligible, you can be paid for one or both parts. If you’re awarded the high-rate mobility, you may get access to the [Motability scheme](https://www.motability.co.uk/how-it-works/).
The government has [more information about PIP](https://www.gov.uk/pip).
Citizens Advice can [help you with your PIP application](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/sick-or-disabled-people-and-carers/pip/help-with-your-claim/fill-in-form/).  
### Scotland
In Scotland, the new Adult Disability Payment (ADP) is replacing PIP.
If you already get PIP, you will automatically be moved onto the ADP. You do not have to reapply. The amount you get will be the same in most cases.
Citizens Advice have [more information about ADP](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/benefits/sick-or-disabled-people-and-carers/adult-disability-payment-s/adult-disability-payment/adult-disability-payment-s/).
## Universal Credit
Universal Credit is a payment that is meant to help with living costs for those who have a low income or are out of work.
Universal Credit is one benefit that replaces Child Tax Credit, Working Tax Credit, Housing Benefit, Income Support, income-related Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) and income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).
The amount you’ll get depends on your circumstances and income. Find out [if you are eligible for Universal Credit](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/universal-credit/on-universal-credit/check-how-much-universal-credit-youll-get/).
Citizens Advice can [help with your Universal Credit application](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/universal-credit/claiming/helptoclaim/). 
## 
 If you need help whilst waiting for benefits to start
If you’re waiting for benefit payments to start, you might be able to get your benefit paid early.
Citizens Advice have [more information on how your local council might be able to help you](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/help-if-on-a-low-income/if-youre-struggling-with-living-costs/).
The government has [information on payments while waiting for Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/other-financial-support).  
## Income support
Income Support can help you cover costs if you’re on a low income. You cannot make a new Income Support claim anymore. If you need support, you can apply for Universal Credit instead.
Citizens Advice have [more information about Income Support](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/help-if-on-a-low-income/income-support/).
## Tax Credits
Universal Credit has replaced working and child tax credits for most people. Before making a claim, you should [check if you can get tax credits](https://cdn.staging.content.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/help-if-on-a-low-income/working-and-child-tax-credits/working-and-child-tax-credits/check-if-you-can-get-working-tax-credits/). If you cannot apply for Tax Credits, you can apply for Universal Credit instead.
There are two types of Tax Credits:
* Child Tax Credit. This is payable to anyone who has children, depending on household income. You can only make a claim for Child Tax Credit if you already get Working Tax Credit.
* Working Tax Credit. This is payable to anyone in low-paid work. You can only make a claim for Working Tax Credit if you already get Child Tax Credit.
Citizens Advice have [more information about tax credits](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/help-if-on-a-low-income/working-and-child-tax-credits/).
## Housing Benefit
You could get Housing Benefit to help pay your rent if you’re on a low income, unemployed or claiming benefits. It’s being replaced by Universal Credit. You can only make a new claim for Housing Benefit if either of the following apply:
* You have reached [state pension age](https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-age).
* You’re in supported, sheltered or temporary housing.
Citizens Advice have [more information about Housing Benefit](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/help-if-on-a-low-income/housing-benefit/).
If you cannot claim Housing Benefit, you might be able to get help with other housing costs. If not, you may be able to claim Universal Credit instead.
To see what you might be entitled to, use the government’s [benefits calculator](https://www.gov.uk/benefits-calculators).
## Statutory Sick Pay (SSP)
If you’re too ill to work, your employer may pay you Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) for up to 28 weeks. If you’re still too sick to work after your SSP ends, you may be able to claim Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).
If you’re self-employed, you cannot claim SSP. You might be eligible for ESA instead.
Find out if you’re entitled to sick pay on [Citizens Advice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/work/rights-at-work/sick-pay/check-if-youre-entitled-to-sick-pay/).
## Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)
Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) can be paid if you have a health condition that affects how much you can work. You can apply if you’re employed, self-employed or unemployed.
Citizens Advice have [more information about ESA](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/sick-or-disabled-people-and-carers/employment-and-support-allowance/). 
## Work-related compensation
You could be entitled to compensation if your lung condition was caused by your work or work you used to do.
### Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit (IIDB)
You might get Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit (IIDB) if you’re sick or disabled as a result of a condition or injury caused by your work. For example, if you live with [asbestosis](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/asbestos-related-conditions/asbestosis).
IIDB is non-means tested. This means it does not depend on your income or any savings you might have.
You must have done certain types of work to be eligible. The amount you can get depends on how your disability or injury affects you. You cannot claim IIDB if you were self-employed.
The government have [more information about IIDB](https://www.gov.uk/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefit).
### Asbestos-related compensation
We have detailed information about compensation if you’ve been diagnosed with an asbestos-related condition.
Find out more about [asbestos financial support](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/asbestos-related-conditions/benefits-and-compensation).

## Blue badge scheme
A blue badge helps you or your carer to park closer to where you’re going. If you get certain benefits, you’re automatically eligible.
You can also apply if you have long-term problems with walking or problems with walking that your doctor says will last at least a year. You’ll have to fill in an extra section of the form and may need an assessment by your local council.
Find out [how to apply for a blue badge in England, Scotland and Wales](https://www.gov.uk/apply-blue-badge).
