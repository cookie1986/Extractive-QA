# Patient Information Leaflets
## The patient information leaflets available for download below have been produced as part of the ACPRC/BTS Guideline appendices.
[![](/data/Publication_Images/treadmill%2Ejpg)](/data/Publication_Images/treadmill%2Ejpg)
These patient leaflets have been produced for our members to access as a resource for patient education and information. Additional leaflets are planned to be developed later this year. We are happy for organisations to utilise these leflets but please acknowledge the ACPRC in your documents.  
The full BTS/ACPRC Guideline for the Physiotherapy Management of the Adult, Medical, Spontaneously Breathing Patient is available by clicking [HERE](https://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/standards-of-care/guidelines/btsacprc-guidelines-for-physiotherapy-management-of-the-adult,-medical,-spontaneously-breathing-patient/ "BTS/ACPRC"), or you can download individual leaflets below.
