## Control exposure
Use the COSHH e-tool to get advice on controlling exposure to hazardous substances for common tasks including mixing and drying. 
[COSHH e-tool](../coshh/essentials/coshh-tool.htm)
## Employers' legal duties
Employers are obliged by law to protect their workers by using:
* alternative processes
* less hazardous materials
* enclosures/effective ventilation
* protective equipmentÂ  - as a last resort
The important thing is to keep workplace air clean.
[Good control practice](../coshh/detail/goodpractice.htm)
## Lung diseases
Breathing in dusts, gases, fumes and vapours in the workplace can cause serious, long-term lung damage and often incurable health problems. Diseases such as:
* [work-related asthma](../asthma/index.htm)
* [COPD](../copd/index.htm)
* [work-related lung cancer](../cancer/index.htm)
* [pneumoconiosis](../lung-disease/pneumoconiosis.htm)
* [silicosis](../lung-disease/silicosis.htm)
* [asbestos-related disease](../asbestos/index.htm)
* [extrinsic allergic alveolitis](../lung-disease/extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis.htm)
## Dust and fume removal

## LOcHER (learning occupational health by experiencing risks)
LOcHER is an interactive learning approach to engage vocational students. It helps them learn about managing health risks and protecting their health in the workplace. This includes occupational lung disease and how to control exposure.
