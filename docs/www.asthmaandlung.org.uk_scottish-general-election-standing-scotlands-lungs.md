# Scottish general election: standing up for Scotland's lungs
At some point in our lives, 1 in 5 of us will have a lung disease. Across the UK, millions more are at risk. As the only UK charity looking after the lungs of Scotland, here's what will make the biggest difference to people living with lung conditions.
To improve lives, we need to do 4 things:
* [Better prevent lung conditions](/scottish-general-election-prevent-it "Scottish general election: prevent it")
* [Better diagnose lung conditions](/scottish-general-election-diagnose-it "Scottish general election: diagnose it")
* [Better treat lung conditions](/scottish-general-election-treat-it "Scottish general election: treat it")
* [And help people live better with lung conditions](/scottish-general-election-live-better-it "Scottish general election: live better with it")
There are simple things we can do. And you can pledge to do some of those things below.
