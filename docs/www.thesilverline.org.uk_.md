# Call free on [0800 4 70 80 90](tel:08004708090)
The Silver Line Helpline is a free, confidential telephone service just for older people. 
  
We provide friendship, conversation and support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
## Everyone needs someone to talk to sometimes
We need connection whatever our age – especially if we live alone or further away from family. The Silver Line Helpline gives anyone aged 55 or over the opportunity to exchange a friendly word, access support, or enjoy a long enriching conversation.
[How we can help](/helping-you/ "Helping you")
![I used The Silver Line every night for about three weeks, and it really kept me going. They’re lovely, I’ve not spoken to anybody that I haven’t felt has been listening or engaging. I can put my hand on my heart and say I don’t think I’d be here without them.](/globalassets/media/580x300_shutterstock_146517560-1.jpg)
