# How to organise a supermarket bag pack
Thank you so much for organising a bag pack to support our work. Just follow the simple steps below and you’ll be off raising cash before you know it!
## Our step-by-step plan to bag packing success!
1. Supermarkets can get booked up in advance, so contact a few - ask whether they allow bag packing and if they have dates available. Do this as early in advance as possible, as busy weekends are likely to book up quickly!
2. Check the available dates with your friends/family, and confirm your preferred date with the store manager to put it in their diary
3. Now, you need to form your packing team!
4. [Let us know!](mailto:community@asthmaandlung.org.uk) We can provide you with everything you need including collection boxes, t-shirts, banners and stickers. If the store needs proof that you’re collecting for us, we can provide you with an authorisation letter
## Top tips for the day
* Arrive in plenty of time for the start of your session
* Bring your confirmation letter from the store and authorisation letter from us!
* Ask the manager if you can display the banners we sent you, to let shoppers know who you’re fundraising for
* Spread out and cover as many tills as possible
* Make sure your team take regular breaks, but ensure any money collected is never left unattended
* Be nice and polite to everyone at your till – even if they decline your kind offer to pack their shopping
* Wear your Asthma + Lung UK t-shirts with pride and chat to shoppers about why you’re supporting us
* Thank the store staff as you leave
* For safety reasons, avoid public transport where possible when carrying large volumes of cash. If you need to catch a bus or train home, make sure you travel in pairs
* Once you’re home, get counting! Have at least two people present when counting the money you’ve raised
## Thank you!
After your bag pack there are just a few last things to do; then you can sit back, put your feet up and give yourself a pat on the back for doing such a great job!
* Say thank you to your bag packing squad and let them know how much you all raised!
* Write to the supermarket to say thank you, and let them know your fundraising total
* Tell us how you got on and [pay in your fundraising!](https://action.asthmaandlung.org.uk/page/99141/donate/1)
