**Anaphylaxis is a severe and potentially life-threatening reaction to a trigger such as an allergy.**
## Symptoms of anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis usually develops suddenly and gets worse very quickly.
The symptoms include:
* feeling [lightheaded or faint](/conditions/dizziness/)
* [breathing difficulties](/conditions/shortness-of-breath/) – such as fast, shallow breathing
* wheezing
* a fast heartbeat
* clammy skin
* [confusion](/conditions/confusion/) and anxiety
* collapsing or losing consciousness
There may also be other [allergy symptoms](/conditions/allergies/symptoms/), including an itchy, raised rash [(hives)](/conditions/hives/); feeling or being sick; swelling [(angioedema)](/conditions/angioedema/) or [stomach pain](/conditions/stomach-ache/).
## What to do if someone has anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency. It can be very serious if not treated quickly.
If someone has symptoms of anaphylaxis:
1. **Use an adrenaline auto-injector if the person has one** – but make sure you know how to use it correctly first.
2. **Call 999 for an ambulance immediately (even if they start to feel better)** – mention that you think the person has anaphylaxis.
3. **Remove any trigger if possible** – for example, carefully remove any stinger stuck in the skin.
4. **Lie the person down and raise their legs** – unless they're having breathing difficulties and need to sit up to help them breathe. If they're pregnant, lie them down on their left side.
5. **Give another injection after 5 minutes** if the symptoms do not improve and a second auto-injector is available.
If you're having an anaphylactic reaction, you can follow these steps yourself if you feel able to.
Read about [how to treat anaphylaxis](/conditions/anaphylaxis/treatment/) for more advice about using auto-injectors and correct positioning.
## Triggers of anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is the result of the immune system, the body's natural defence system, overreacting to a trigger.
This is often something you're allergic to, but not always.
Common anaphylaxis triggers include:
* foods – including nuts, milk, fish, shellfish, eggs and some fruits
* medicines – including some [antibiotics](/conditions/antibiotics/) and [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)](/conditions/nsaids/) like [aspirin](/conditions/aspirin/)
* [insect stings](/conditions/insect-bites-and-stings/) – particularly wasp and bee stings
* [general anaesthetic](/conditions/general-anaesthesia/)
* contrast agents – dyes used in some medical tests to help certain areas of your body show up better on scans
* latex – a type of rubber found in some rubber gloves and condoms
In some cases, there's no obvious trigger. This is known as idiopathic anaphylaxis.
## Preventing anaphylaxis
If you have a serious allergy or have experienced anaphylaxis before, it's important to try to prevent future episodes.
The following can help reduce your risk:
* identify any triggers – you may be referred to an allergy clinic for [allergy tests](/conditions/allergies/) to check for anything that could trigger anaphylaxis
* avoid triggers whenever possible – for example, be careful when food shopping or eating out if you have a [food allergy](/conditions/food-allergy/)
* carry 2 in-date adrenaline auto-injectors at all times – give yourself an injection whenever you think you may be experiencing anaphylaxis, even if you're not completely sure
