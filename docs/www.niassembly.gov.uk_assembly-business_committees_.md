There are currently no Assembly Committees
 
 
## What is a committee?
Committees are groups of MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly) who look at specific subjects such as health, education, justice and more. Committee members come from different political parties.
Committees:
* hold the Northern Ireland Executive (the government) to account
* hold inquiries
* ask for your views
* examine bills (proposed laws) and decide on amendments (changes)
* introduce their own bills
Committees have a remit which says what areas they are responsible for. Committees can look at anything in their remit.

### Standing Committees
