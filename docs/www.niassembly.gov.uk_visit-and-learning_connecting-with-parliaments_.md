# Connecting with UK & International Visitors & Parliamentary Bodies
### Inward Visits
The Engagement Office develops tailor-made programmes to meet the needs of the many delegations requesting visits to the Northern Ireland Assembly.
The Assembly receives a large number of requests, primarily from Embassies, post-conflict countries and universities wishing to visit Parliament Buildings to discuss and share experiences with Northern Ireland politicians. 
In 2019, the Assembly organised and hosted 64 visits from countries such as South Korea, Nepal, Georgia, and Canada to name but a few.  To request a visit to the Northern Ireland Assembly please complete and return the [Visits Enquiry Form](/visit-and-learning/connecting-with-parliaments/request-a-visit/).

### Parliamentary Bodies
The Northern Ireland Assembly is represented on various parliamentary bodies by MLAs. These bodies include the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly, the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe. Involvement with these bodies allows MLAs to voice their opinions on various global issues and to learn from the experiences of other parliaments throughout the world. 
The Engagement Office assists the Assembly’s continued participation with these bodies by organising conferences and events and ensuring attendance at various meetings throughout the year.
