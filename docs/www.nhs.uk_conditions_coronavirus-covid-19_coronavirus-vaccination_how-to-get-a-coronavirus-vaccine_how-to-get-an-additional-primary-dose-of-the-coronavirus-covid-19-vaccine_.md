 How to get an additional primary dose of the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine
If you are aged 5 or over and had a severely weakened immune system when you had your first 2 doses of the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, you may be offered an additional primary dose (3rd dose) before any booster doses.
Your immune system may not have responded as well as other people’s to your first 2 doses. An additional primary dose (3rd dose) should improve your protection and reduce your risk of prolonged illness or serious complications from COVID-19.
## Who can get an additional primary dose
The NHS should contact you if you are eligible for an additional primary dose (3rd dose) of the COVID-19 vaccine.
People who may be eligible can include those who had or have:
* a blood cancer (such as leukaemia or lymphoma)
* a weakened immune system due to a treatment (such as steroid medicine, biological therapy, chemotherapy or radiotherapy)
* an organ or bone marrow transplant
* a condition that means you have a very high risk of getting infections
* a disease which affects your immune system (such as HIV, depending on your viral load)
* a condition or treatment your specialist advises makes you eligible for an additional primary dose (3rd dose)
If you developed a severely weakened immune system at least 2 weeks after your 2nd dose, you will not usually need an additional primary dose.
Information: 
If you think you're eligible for an additional primary dose but have not been contacted, speak to your GP surgery or specialist.
## How to get an additional primary dose of the COVID-19 vaccine
If you are eligible, you may be able to get an additional primary dose (3rd dose) of the COVID-19 vaccine at a walk-in vaccination site.
You can also speak to your specialist or GP practice to find out if they are providing vaccination services.
### Go to a walk-in vaccination site
If you or your child are aged 5 or over, you may be able to go to some walk-in vaccination sites to get your additional primary dose (3rd dose) without needing an appointment.

### What to bring to your appointment at a walk-in vaccination site
It can help if you bring either:
* an NHS letter inviting you for an additional primary dose (3rd dose)
* a hospital letter that describes the condition or treatment that caused you to have a severely weakened immune system at the time of your 1st or 2nd dose
* a prescription or a medicine box with your name and the date showing when the medicine was prescribed – this must show that you had a severely weakened immune system at the time of your 1st or 2nd dose
If you think you're eligible for an additional primary dose (3rd dose) but you do not have a suitable letter, prescription, or medicine box, it may still be possible to get vaccinated.
When you arrive for your appointment, you can discuss your eligibility with a healthcare professional. They will check to make sure you're eligible.
## When to get your COVID-19 vaccine
You'll usually be offered an additional primary dose (3rd dose) at least 8 weeks after your 2nd primary dose.
Your GP or hospital specialist may suggest a different time if you have any ongoing or planned treatment that affects your immune system.

If you or your child have COVID-19, or [symptoms of COVID-19](/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/), you should wait until your symptoms are better before you get the vaccine.
You should wait:
* 4 weeks (28 days) if you’re aged 18 or over
* 12 weeks (84 days) if you or your child are aged 5 to 17
* 4 weeks (28 days) if you or your child are aged 5 to 17 and at high risk from COVID-19, or live with someone who has a weakened immune system
This starts from the date your symptoms started or the date of a positive test, whichever was earlier.
