### Visitors who are deaf or hard of hearing
The Assembly was proud to hold the 'Louder than Words' charter mark for over 12 years. However, in February 2022 the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID) advised the Assembly that it had made some changes, and as a result this accreditation is no longer available to organisations. Nevertheless, the Assembly continues to adhere to the standards of the accreditation and to provide excellent levels of service and accessibility to building users and employees who are deaf or hard of hearing. The Assembly also continues its excellent relationship with RNID for advice, training and equipment.

For tours of Parliament Buildings, a Hearing Helper radio system is available for people who are hard of hearing or those in large groups and a signed tour in British and Irish sign language is also available on request.

### Busy and quiet periods
![Busy and quiet periods at Parliament Buildings](/globalassets/global/site-images/dissyms/busy-logo.png)The building can be very busy and noisy, especially on Mondays and Tuesdays, which are the days when the Assembly sits. Committees usually meet on Wednesdays and Thursdays, with Fridays generally being the quietest day of the week, although this will depend on what exhibitions and events are on.
You can check our [business diary](http://aims.niassembly.gov.uk/assemblybusiness/businessdiary.aspx) to see what meetings and sittings are on at the Assembly.
On sitting days in particular, the car park may fill up quickly, so visitors may be asked to park elsewhere, for example, on Prince of Wales Avenue. Please allow additional time to get to and from your car on sitting days. Parking for blue badge holders should always be arranged in advance – contact details are in the ‘Disability Parking’ section at the top of the page.
The Assembly is quieter during recess periods. There are four recess periods a year: Easter, Summer, Halloween and Christmas. [Find the latest information on recess dates](/about-the-assembly/general-information/).
