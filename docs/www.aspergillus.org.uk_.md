# Global research at your fingertips.
The Aspergillus website is a comprehensive resource providing detailed information about the fungus Aspergillus and the diseases it can cause, these are usually called aspergillosis.

![](https://www.aspergillus.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/aspergillus-lab-pic-1024x848.jpg)
This site is free to use and provides an encyclopaedia of Aspergillus for doctors, scientists, patients and their relatives. Some parts of the site require free registration, for example the image bank.
The Aspergillus Website is governed by the [Fungal Infection Trust](http://www.fungalinfectiontrust.org) in partnership with the University of Manchester. It has an independent Editorial Board. It is supported by educational grants from the UK National health Service and some commercial supporters.

### What is Aspergillus?
Aspergillus is a fungus whose spores are present in the air we breathe, but does not normally cause illness. In those  people with a weakened immune system, damaged lungs or with allergies, Aspergillus can cause disease. Common Aspergillus infections include [invasive aspergillosis](/aspergillosis), [ABPA](/content/allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis-abpa), [CPA and aspergilloma.](/chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis-cpa-and-aspergilloma-2/)
[Aspergillosis](/aspergillosis/) is a group of diseases which can result from aspergillus infection, including [invasive aspergillosis](/aspergillosis/), [ABPA](/content/allergic-bronchopulmonary-aspergillosis-abpa), [CPA and aspergilloma](/chronic-pulmonary-aspergillosis-cpa-and-aspergilloma-2/). Aspergillus can affect humans and animals, as well as causing plant diseases and food spoilage. Visit [LIFE-Worldwide](https://en.fungaleducation.org/) for detailed information on other types of fungal infections, such as cryptococcus, candida and many others.  
### Aspergillus in the air
Sources of high numbers of Aspergillus spores include air conditioning units, composting and damp or flood damaged housing & hospital building projects.
