# Take our breath test
Feeling short of breath from time to time is healthy and normal – but sometimes it can be a sign of something more serious. If you’re worried about breathlessness, take our [quick online breath test](https://breathtest.blf.org.uk/).
Our breath test helps you find out more about your symptoms and see if it's time to see a doctor. The questions we ask are based on the [Medical Research Council breathlessness scale](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/breathlessness/diagnosis). They're designed to find out which tasks make you breathless.

## Why take our breath test?
We all feel short of breath from time to time. That’s healthy and normal. But sometimes it can be a sign of something more serious. Our breath test helps you decide if you should speak to your doctor about it.
Sometimes people don't tell their doctor or nurse about feeling out of breath because they don’t realise there is help available, they think it’s just a part of ageing or they feel responsible in some way.

## What help can I get?
If getting out of breath is a sign of something more serious, getting treatment sooner will help you manage your breathlessness better. And as well as treating the causes, there are lots of ways you can take control and get the most out of life.
There are lots of things you can do to look after your lungs, even if you don't need to get them checked out. Our breath test gives you personalised advice on things you can do to take better care of your lungs and your overall wellbeing.

## How can I find out more about breathlessness?
You can read our [information about breathlessness](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/breathlessness). It explains what it is, what causes it, how it’s diagnosed and how to manage it.
If you have any questions, [get in touch with our helpline](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/helpline).
