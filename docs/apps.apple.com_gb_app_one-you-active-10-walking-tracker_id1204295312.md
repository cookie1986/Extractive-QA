BRISK WALKING BENEFITS YOUR HEALTH  
  
We all know how important it is to be active. The good news is you don’t have to go to the gym or start expensive fitness programmes, walking briskly counts too!  
  
Just ten minutes of brisk walking every day can get your heart pumping and can make you feel more energetic, as well as lowering your risk of serious illnesses like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Going for a brisk walk is a great way to clear your head and improve your mood.  
  
Active 10's are simple to fit into your day, from taking the dog out to going for a lunchtime walk there are lot of opportunities to include brisk walking into your daily routine.  
  
This app relies on your phone’s inbuilt sensors to measure your activity so you may experience varying levels of accuracy especially in older devices/operating systems. To improve accuracy, we recommend keeping your phone in a pocket close to your body rather than in a loose coat pocket or bag.  
  
If you have any feedback on how we can improve the app please send it to BetterHealth@phe.gov.uk

 Acive 10
> 
> I have finished Chemo for two benign conditions. Even four years ago when I was 54 I still went to the leisure centre and attended circuit sessions twice a week, spin classes and the Gym. I had surgery in February and whilst recovering from that had to go onto a harsh chemo. I finished the chemo seven weeks ago and was using all the excuses to get out of any kind of exercise. I was self isolating, lost my hair due to chemo, lost my confidence as I was convinced that I was to weak and ill to exercise. I downloaded the active 10 app and it has changed my life for good. I have managed to do ten minutes of brisk walking every day. I can now wear a wooly cap, put on my walking shoes or trainers and there is no stopping me. I’m a retired primary school teacher and the reward scheme is just up my street. That has increased my confidence as well. I hope in the next couple of weeks that I can increase to 20 minutes a day. Without the app I would be sitting at home and not doing any exercise at all. It’s been a lifesaver.

 Good idea but!
> 
> This app is a good idea and I like the way it shows when you are walking briskly. However, I am not over happy with location services being on all the time and would prefer "whilst using" setting to be allowed. Only used it one day so far so accuracy cannot comment on but what I seen looks correct. It is a basic app though as today I cannot find anyway of seeing what I did yesterday only a graph showing I did 40 minutes above my 10 minute brisk walk goal. This app needs some work on it to give it more features. I have used a different Public Health England app before and that was also rather basic! This app is an excellent idea but I don't think it will be on my phone long if updates are not forthcoming in the very near future to change location services option and giving it a few more features.

> Thanks for responding to my review. I have now upgraded to 4 stars as having used it daily now I can see that the accuracy is correct. I also appreciate that Location Services do need to be on to track my daily activity and also I know now that it is not draining my battery too much which was one of my concerns for this. I would though still like to have some history of my previous days/weeks/months with detail as some other Apps do. On the whole it is a good App and I really like the fact I can see when I am walking briskly. Will now keep on my phone for a bit longer and look forward to seeing future updates.

 Handy App
> 
> See below for update.   
> Logs all activity that involves moving from one place to another. That in itself is useful as it highlights active and sedentary periods during the day. I am not entirely convinced that the logging of the 'brisk' walking periods is totally accurate. Some periods when I know I have been walking briskly have not been recognised whereas other periods where I was not expecting walking to be recognised as brisk have been. I am a little disappointed that brisk periods under ten minutes do not count towards the goal even when accumulated they suggest the target has been reached. I accumulated 20 mins brisk walking yesterday but because they were in small chunks I 'failed' to reach my target. So far as time delay in updating mentioned by some other reviewers I have found updating occurs when the app is on the home page. Easy to swipe between pages and keep up to date. I will continue to use the app if only to get me off the sofa more often.  
>   
> Not overly keen on redesign. I liked the line graph and the one that showed periods during the day when I had got up and walked. These have now gone. In addition I walked 55 minutes briskly on Monday, received 5 cups and a medal only to find that on Tuesday the whole of Monday’s walking had been wiped completely. Disappointing. The only improvement is that every brisk minute now counts - if the app records and keeps it. I have removed a star.
