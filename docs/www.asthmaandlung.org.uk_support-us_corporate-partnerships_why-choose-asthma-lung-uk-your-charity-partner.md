# Why choose Asthma + Lung UK as your charity partner?
Choosing Asthma + Lung UK as your charity partner can bring long lasting benefits to your company whilst raising vital funds to support people living with a lung condition.
One in five of us will develop a lung condition in our lifetime. It could be the mothers, fathers, grandparents and children that make up your customer base. It could be you. Unfortunately, this invisible killer takes far more than just our breath away. Lung disease is the UK’s third biggest killer, with someone losing their life or a loved one every 5 minutes.
We will work with you to build a meaningful and engaging partnership that delivers value for both your company and our charity. Lung disease is a cause that resonates with millions of people across the UK, and we’ll be able to educate your employees and customers on lung disease and support them to look after their lungs. Our dedicated corporate partnership team are committed to ensuring that our partnerships are a success.
## We can support you with:
* A dedicated account manager and experienced team – you will be designated a key contact in our team who will be on hand to inspire and motivate your colleagues throughout our partnership.
* Press support – our press team will be on hand to help you maximise any coverage you gain as a result of our partnership.
* Exciting fundraising and engagement opportunities for your colleagues and audiences.
