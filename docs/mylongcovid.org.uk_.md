# My Long COVID Needs
**Long COVID is used to describe symptoms that last for weeks or months after getting COVID-19. Symptoms might include breathlessness, fatigue, brain fog or headaches. This can have an impact on many different areas of your life, such as work, money and education.** 
## **What is the My Long COVID Needs assessment tool?**
My Long COVID Needs is an assessment tool that will help you to understand your current Long COVID symptoms, your needs, what to do next and what help you can get. It’s anonymous and in user testing has taken people around 5-10 minutes to complete.
This tool is most useful when describing the problems you’re having at the moment due to Long COVID, rather than past problems. 
## **How will this tool help me?**
My Long COVID Needs is designed to help you when explaining your Long COVID symptoms to your GP. You might want to print out your answers after you've finished your assessment, and take them with you to your GP appointment. Your GP will be able to read your results and advise you on what to do next. It could be helpful to share your results with other health care professionals treating you, or your employer too, so they can see what needs you have.
We also have some useful links to websites where you can [find more advice and support about Long COVID](https://mylongcovid.org.uk/where-to-get-help).
