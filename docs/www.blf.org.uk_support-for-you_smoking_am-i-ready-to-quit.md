## What’s the best way to quit smoking?
The best way to quit smoking is by using specialist help and stop smoking treatments together. You’re around three times more likely to quit if you use treatments alongside stop smoking support. For example, using a [local stop smoking service](https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/quit-smoking/find-your-local-stop-smoking-service/) and using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or e-cigarettes.
You’re also more likely to be successful with the support of friends, family, and your doctor or stop smoking adviser. 
## Stop smoking service
Local stop smoking services give you free expert advice and support to stop smoking.
Your GP will be able to refer you. You can also [contact your local stop smoking service yourself](https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/quit-smoking/find-your-local-stop-smoking-service/), for support.
If you have a long-term lung condition, like [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/copd) or [pulmonary fibrosis](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/pulmonary-fibrosis), your doctor should offer you support in stopping smoking every time you meet them.
The NHS has information about [what to expect from a stop smoking service](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/quit-smoking/nhs-stop-smoking-services-help-you-quit/). Depending on where you live in the UK, sessions may be by phone or video call, or in person at GP surgeries or pharmacies.
You may be offered support through an app, text messages or another digital platform in addition to help you stop smoking. There are plenty of apps available to help you stop smoking – search online for one that suits you. You may want to try the Smokefree app. It’s a four-week programme of practical support, encouragement, and tailored advice.
## Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)
Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) comes in different forms and helps you to control the urge to smoke. It’s available on prescription from your GP or local stop smoking service, or to buy from a pharmacy.
All the therapies give you a low level of nicotine, without the tar, carbon monoxide and other poisonous chemicals that are in tobacco smoke. Over time you can slowly reduce the amount of nicotine you get, and eventually stop using NTR completely.
Therapies include:
* patches
* gum
* sprays
* lozenges
* inhalators.
Most people will combine two types of NRT. This is usually a nicotine patch to provide a background level of NRT and a faster-acting product, such as gum, inhalator, or nasal spray, to use when you get cravings.
People usually take NRT for 8-12 weeks before slowly reducing the dose and stopping. Ask your GP, pharmacist or stop smoking service for help in choosing the right NRTs for you.
## 
 Talk to your GP or asthma nurse if:
* NRT inhalators irritate your throat or make you cough
* NRT nasal sprays make you cough.
## Stop smoking medicines
Your GP can prescribe you medicine to help you stop smoking. There is currently one medicine available on the NHS, called Bupropion (Zyban).
If you’re prescribed Zyban, you’ll need to take the tablets for around 7 to 9 weeks.
## 
 Talk to your GP or asthma nurse if:
* it’s harder to breathe
* you’re wheezing more.
This is because in rare cases, Zyban can cause allergic reactions.
## Vaping and e-cigarettes
E-cigarettes are also a form of nicotine replacement therapy, as the vapour usually includes nicotine. Evidence suggests that they are slightly more effective at helping people quit smoking than other NRT products.
Find out more about vaping and e-cigarettes. 
## Hypnotherapy and other ways to quit
Some people find complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, hypnotherapy, or meditation help them quit smoking.
However, there's no clear evidence to prove they can help people quit, and they’re not available on the NHS as part of a stop smoking plan.
Alongside licensed stop smoking treatments and expert support, there’s nothing to stop you trying complementary therapies too. They could support your overall stop smoking plan. Lots of complementary therapies also help with stress.
## Make a plan to quit smoking
Having a plan to quit smoking will help you to stay motivated and eventually, quit for good. Always remember the reasons why you want to quit. Don’t quit quitting – try our three step plan:
### 1. See your GP for support
* Ask for a prescription for medication to help you quit.
* Ask for a referral to a stop smoking service.
* Download a stop smoking app for extra support.
### 2. Set a date to quit
* Tell your friends and family when you plan to quit.
* Tell yourself you are a non-smoker.
* Find someone else to quit smoking with you.
### 3. Distract yourself from cravings
* Leave the room if your friends are smoking.
* Keep your hands and mouth busy.
* Get outside for some fresh air.
If the method you’re using isn’t working for you, try something else.
