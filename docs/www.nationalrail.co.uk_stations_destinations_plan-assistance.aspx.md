**What is Passenger Assist?**
Passenger Assist allows you to request an assistance booking in advance - now up to 2 hours before your journey is due to start, any time of the day.
Passenger Assist includes:
* offering a helping hand to navigate the station
* support when boarding the train
* meeting you from your train and taking you to your next train or the exit
* arranging a ramp on or off your train
* assistance relating to a non-visible impairment
* carrying your bag(s) if your disability means that you are unable to do so yourself – up to three items of luggage as per the [National Rail Conditions of Travel](/National%20Rail%20Conditions%20of%20Travel.pdf)
The train company you’re travelling with will organise assistance for your entire journey, even if you travel with another train company as part of your journey.

### **How to request assistance via Passenger Assist**
There are a number of ways to request assistance.
In May 2021, we introduced **Passenger Assistance by Transreport** – a new app which allows you to request assistance via an internet-enabled smartphone. You receive a confirmation email once your request has been checked and confirmed. You can find out more about the app on our [Passenger Assistance by Transreport page](/stations_destinations/passenger_assistance.aspx).
You can also call for free on **0800 0223720** or text **60083**. For textphone/minicom, please dial **0845 60 50 600.**
Simply let us know the journey you are planning on taking, and we will connect you to the appropriate train company to confirm your booking request.
For text and textphone we will send an instant SMS with the number you need to dial from your textphone unit. 
You can also request assistance via the Passenger Assistance [Web App](https://booking.passengerassistance.com/).
If you have any queries on or issues with your assistance booking, you can get in contact with the relevant train company by using the [Train company contact details](#Contact) below.

### **Planning assistance in advance**
It is always best to book assistance as far ahead as possible but train companies now accept assistance booking requests up to 2 hours before your journey is scheduled to start, any time of the day. 
 
[Back to top](#)
### **Last minute requests (Turn up and Go)**
We want you to feel confident when travelling by rail and understand the importance of supporting flexible travel plans.
You can 'turn up and go' without booking assistance in advance but if you require assistance at short notice, please make yourself known to a member of staff or use a Help Point when you arrive at the station.
Where a station is staffed, they will always help you if they can. However, customers should be aware that it may mean that, on occasion, it could take a little longer as staff may be assisting other customers, dispatching a train, or looking after safety on the platform.
If staff are not in a position to help you straight away, they will explain clearly why not and do their best to assist as soon as they can.
 
[Back to top](#)
### **Do I still need a ticket to travel?**
Yes, you must hold a valid ticket before travelling on the National Rail network. 
However, if you cannot buy a ticket before travel due to an impairment, you will not have to pay more on the train or at your destination, than what you would have paid prior to getting on the train; including any applicable discount.
We advise buying your ticket via [www.nationalrail.co.uk](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk) before you request assistance to ensure you get the best value for money for your journey.
