# Financial support for mesothelioma
If you have mesothelioma, your financial circumstances might change. You might have extra expenses such as travel costs to hospital. You might feel worried about how you and your family are going to manage financially. If you’re diagnosed with mesothelioma, you and your family can apply for financial assistance.
> Read more about getting [legal advice and claiming compensation for your mesothelioma diagnosis](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/mesothelioma/support/specialist-legal-support).

You might be entitled to claim general state benefits. This can really help with your family’s income. Some key benefits to be aware of are:
[**Industrial injuries disablement benefit (IIDB)**](https://www.gov.uk/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefit). This is for people who can show they were exposed to asbestos in their job (even if they didn’t work directly with asbestos). People cannot claim who were self-employed at the time they were exposed to asbestos.
[**Personal Independence Payment (PIP)**](https://www.gov.uk/pip), previously known as Disability Living Allowance, is available (depending on your circumstances) if you are aged under 65 when you apply. 
[**Attendance Allowance**](https://www.gov.uk/attendance-allowance) is a benefit for people aged 65 or older. 
[**Carer’s Allowance**](https://www.gov.uk/carers-allowance) is for people who care for someone with substantial caring needs for 35 hours a week or more.
[**Employment and Support Allowance**](https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance) is a benefit for people who are of working age but are unable to work because of their illness. 
The **Blue Badge scheme** is a parking badge which helps you park closer to your destination. For more information, go to the following websites:
* [England and Wales](https://www.gov.uk/blue-badge-scheme-information-council)
* [Scotland](https://www.mygov.scot/apply-blue-badge/)
* [Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/services/apply-or-renew-blue-badge-online)
**Special rules for terminally ill people**. If a person is terminally ill and expected to live for six months or less, they can get Attendance Allowance or Personal Independence Payment immediately. The Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) will fast-track the application.
> You can read more about these benefits in our [welfare benefits information](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/welfare-benefits). You can also read free online advice and find your local Citizen’s Advice Bureau (CAB) on the [CAB website](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/).
