![](images/title-block.gif)### Jump for charity
Many people who make a parachute jump do so whilst raising funds for a 
worthwhile cause. Skyline are the largest organisers of sponsored charity jumps 
in the UK working with well over 3,000 charities who will all pay for your 
charity skydive in return for you raising a minimum amount of funds for them. By 
doing this you get your jump for FREE and the information on this page explains 
how you can take advantage of this...

4. Cant find a particular charity? [Click here to book](//www.skylineparachuting.co.uk/booking.aspx?ad=charityalt) and you will be given 
 an option to provide your suggested alternative
![](images/title-block.gif)### Jump for FREE
In return for raising a minimum amount of sponsorship money a charity will 
pay for your jump and training and receive a sizable donation from your efforts 
at the same time! The minimum amounts you will be asked to raise differ from 
charity to charity but on average they are as follows:
**Tandem Skydive: £395\***   
**Static Line Square: £360**  
**Accelerated Freefall: £535**   
\*Please note that some airfields require a higher sponsorship level of £450 – you can call 020 7424 5522 for more information. 
From these sums the charity will receive an average donation of £140 and you 
will receive your parachute jump for FREE! Simply select your charity from the 
list above and you can either book online or request a free information pack and 
sponsorship forms. 
![](images/title-block.gif)### Points to remember
With this sponsorship scheme you don't even have to pay all the sponsorship 
money up front. With most charities you will be required to reserve your place 
with a small booking deposit and raise the remaining sponsorship for your 
skydive either online with a fundraising page or offline with cash sponsors 
before your skydive. Alternatively if people are sponsoring you once you have 
completed the skydive you can pay for your jump on the day, and reimburse 
yourself once you collect these in. Don’t forget, once minimum sponsorship is 
raised you are also eligible to reimburse yourself for your deposit through 
offline donations you have collected. 
![](images/title-block.gif)### Who benefits from charity skydives?
All the charities we are currently working with are listed at the top of this 
page and all of these operate the above sponsorship scheme. If you wish to jump 
for an alternative cause please call us on 020 7424 5500 and we will see if we 
can arrange this for you. 
![](images/title-block.gif)### How to get started
Simply choose a charity from the the list at the top of this page and either 
fill in the online booking form or request an information pack, and we will send 
you a FREE charity pack. Remember, if you raise the minimum amount of 
sponsorship money you will receive your jump for FREE whilst at the same time 
raising vital funds for your chosen cause!
