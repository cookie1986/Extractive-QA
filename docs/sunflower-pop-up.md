# **The first Sunflower pop-up shop**
**at the Icon Outlet at The O2**
Visit us at our first Sunflower Pop-Up at the Icon Outlet at The O2 in North Greenwich during this February half-term. We're on hand from Saturday 11 February to Wednesday 15 February 2023 to hear from you in person, to raise awareness of non-visible disabilities and to promote the Hidden Disabilities Sunflower.Â 
## Think you know about dyslexia, stammering or FASD?
Meet [Dayna Halliwell](#dyslexia) and the [STAMMA](#stamma) and [National FASD](#fasd) teams to find out more about each non-visible disability between Monday 13 February and Wednesday 15 February. Contribute to the Positive Vibes wall, get creative, giveaways, or simply have a chat, and much more!
And if your disability is not listed? Don't worry, the Sunflower team is on hand at the pop-up. So [plan your visit](#where) and come and have a chat, help yourself to sweets, find out about [Purple Sock Day](#purple) as well as our attempt to create [the world's longest lanyard](#wll) and take home some sunflower seeds to grow your own sunflower! There are different in-store events planned for each day that we're open.
## What's on
![A dark green banner with yellow text that reads: Saturday 11 February - Wednesday 15 February. the Sunflower is on the right with a lanyard ribbon around it.](https://hiddendisabilitiesstore.com/media/wysiwyg/Newsletter/dates.jpg)
## Do you have a non-visible disability?
Come and pick up your **FREE Sunflower lanyard** to get the support you need as you shop, travel, work or enjoy your days out.Â Â 
While youâre here, we can help you order a personalised Sunflower card. As diverse as non-visible disabilities are, so are each person's access needs and the barriers they face in their daily lives. So if you have a hidden disability, you can opt to use a personalised Sunflower card to identify your individual access needs.Â 
And if you want to show your support for the Sunflower and people living with non-visible disabilities, weâll have **FREE âI support the Sunflowerâ lanyards** for you on each day that the store is open.Â Â

## Share your Sunflower voice
While itâs easy to feel that your story canât possibly make a meaningful difference, the truth is that it can influence individuals and the wider community. Whether you or someone you care about is someone living with a disability and wears the Sunflower, you can empower others and encourage people to support them by sharing your experience.Â  
Our Sunflower video booth will be up and running for five days. Here you can be the star of your own Sunflower story. Sharing your lived experience and the role the Sunflower plays in your life.

## Dyslexia with Dayna
**Monday 13 February 2023**
*"For me, I really struggle with memory and remembering information. The classics, spelling, having great ideas in my head, but just really struggling to write them down without assistance or help. But I do think dyslexia affects many areas of my life, that I've perhaps been unaware of, whether it's taking down WiFi passwords, or finding the train times.â*
Come and meet Dayna Halliwell, who you may better know as Dyslexicdayna on **[TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@dyslexicdayna)** and **[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dyslexicdayna/)**. Dayna is a disabled actor, writer, theatre practitioner/maker and online content creator whose work tackles political and social issues by using creative engagement on a community level. Dayna will be casting a live event on both her TikTok and Instagram channels from the Sunflower store!Â 
## My Mind is a Series of Unfinished Doodles Planner
Discover Daynaâs neurodivergent friendly planner to help with organisation, whether thatâs planning your month, week, projects or making a checklist. Available to purchase in-store.Â 
## Positive vibes wall
Have you ever thought about the message you would send to your younger self? Be inspired to share the wisdom you have today on our Positive Vibes wall in-store to be featured on our social media channels and in our newsletter! You can choose to remain anonymous. Anyone that writes an inspirational message on the wall will be entered into a prize draw with the chance to win a bundle of giveaways including one of Dayna's journals.Â 
## Let's get creative
Inspire others by sharing an inspirational quote with us in-store. Dayna will then collate the day's quotes and turn them into a reel to be played on her social channels.Â

## 'It's how we talk' with STAMMA
**Tuesday 13 February 2023**
Come and join STAMMA and help us spread the love about stammering. Throughout the day weâll be talking about what it means to be a person who stammers, how friends and family can help, and how you can be a stammering ally. Weâll have free giveaways and fun challenges, so come join us this Valentineâs Day in unit 48 at the Icon Outlet at The O2 arena.
STAMMA, also known as the British Stammering Association is the UKâs leading charity for people who stammer. They are dedicated to creating a world which makes space for stammering. We want all people who stammer to be able to reach their full potential, and not be judged or discriminated against because of the way that they speak. Here for anyone in the UK who stammers, they offer support and information for those that stammer and those around them. They're here to connect people, to support and provide information, and to advocate for and represent those who stammer.
  
STAMMA aims to challenge discrimination wherever they find it, helping the public to understand that stammering is not a sign of being shy, drunk, dishonest, nervous or weak. It's simply how some of us talk.Â

Stammering is a speech and communication disorder. It usually involves prolongations and repetitions of sounds and syllables, or hesitations or blocks when trying to say words or sounds. For example, a person who stutters may know what they want to say but have trouble saying it. Â

## The world's longest lanyard
We believe that the more we all understand about non-visible disabilities, the more we can help to improve the lives of people experiencing them. To raise awareness of the wide range of non-visible disabilities, chronic illnesses and conditions that Sunflower wearers experience, we need your help.
We're aiming to produce the world's longest lanyard. By naming an invisible disability with us, you'll become part of our World Record attempt!
Each disability, condition or chronic illness that that is added to our list increases the length of our lanyard and gets added onto a huge Sunflower card. We're setting our sights high and aim to have captured so many hidden disabilities that we'll produce the world's longest lanyard.Â 
**Contribute a non-visible disability to our list today.**

**The Hidden Disabilities Sunflower is part of Hidden Disabilities Sunflower Scheme Limited, a private company based in the UK.**
*The Hidden Disabilities Sunflower products are strictly not for resale by individuals, businesses or organisations - they are intended to be donated to your colleagues and customers free of charge.**Official products are only available from this website as well as from registered charities who are Sunflower Members and who have been authorised to sell the product. These charities will display an official badge and will be selling official Hidden Disabilities Sunflower products. Hidden Disabilities Sunflower products being sold on eBay or Amazon are being resold at inflated prices or are counterfeit or copycat versions which can be misleading, cause confusion by not being recognised quickly by members of the scheme and may mean wearers are not helped as intended.*
