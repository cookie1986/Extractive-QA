Housing Benefit
# Housing Benefit
Universal Credit has replaced Housing Benefit for most people. Before you make a claim, you should [check if you can get Housing Benefit](/benefits/help-if-on-a-low-income/housing-benefit/help-with-your-housing-benefit-claim/check-if-you-can-get-housing-benefit/). You might need to [claim Universal Credit](/benefits/universal-credit/) instead.
