# BTS ILD Registry
The BTS ILD Registry holds national longitudinal data for two disease areas, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and sarcoidosis. The aim of the Registry is to provide a means of reviewing nationwide data to increase understanding of epidemiology and ultimately help to improve patient care. 
[Access the BTS ILD Registry here](https://registry.brit-thoracic.org.uk/WebPages/Login/frmLogin.aspx "BTS ILD Registry")

If you are a clinician who is interested in participating please [registry@brit-thoracic.org.uk](mailto:registry@brit-thoracic.org.uk)for details.  Please see the Lung Disease Registry FAQs document and other sources of information below. 
If you are a patient interested in learning more about the Registry please see the Information for Patients document below. If you would like to join the Registry please speak with your consultant.  If you have been diagnosed with IPF or sarcoidosis and would like more information about the disease please visit the sites for Action for Pulmonary Fibrosis, SarcoidosisUK and the British Lung Foundation  – these charities provide information and support for patients.
