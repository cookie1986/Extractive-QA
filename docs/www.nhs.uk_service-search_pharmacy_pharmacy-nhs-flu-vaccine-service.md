 Find a pharmacy that offers NHS flu vaccination
## Who can have an NHS flu vaccine from a pharmacy
You can get a free NHS flu vaccine from a pharmacy if:
* you're aged 50 years old or over (including if you'll be 50 years old by 31 March 2023)
* you have certain medical conditions
* you're pregnant
* you're a frontline adult social care worker who cannot get a vaccination from your employer
The pharmacy will tell you how and when you can book your vaccination.

### **Children under 18 years old**
Children under 18 years old cannot get a flu vaccination at a pharmacy. But they may be able to get it from their GP surgery or school.

### **Health and social care workers with vouchers**
If you have been given a voucher for a flu vaccine by your employer, you'll be able to use this at a pharmacy that offers this service. Check with the pharmacy if they'll accept the voucher.
If you're a social care worker who is eligible to have a flu vaccine on the NHS, you do not need to present your ID at a pharmacy. However, if your employer can provide you with a letter identifying you as a social care worker it may make things easier on the day.
