# Trusts and foundations
Could your trust or foundation support us?

12 million people in the UK are living with a lung condition. That’s more than cardiovascular disease and non-respiratory cancers combined.
That’s where we come in. We're the UK’s only charity supporting everyone affected by lung conditions.
We provide **hope**, **help** and a **voice**.
* **Hope**: our [research](/research-health-professionals "Research + health professionals") finds new ways to prevent, treat and cure lung disease
* **Help**: our [support groups](/help/support-network "Support Groups + Singing for Lung Health Groups"), Asthma + Lung UK [helpline](/helpline "Speak to our Helpline") and other services give people who struggle to breathe the skills, knowledge and confidence to take control of their lives
* **Voice**: together, we’re [campaigning](/support-us/campaign-with-us "Campaign with us") for clean air and better services
Our vision is that one day, everyone will breathe clean air with healthy lungs. Only your support can make that happen.

## Support us
While the number of people dying from conditions like heart disease and many non-respiratory cancers is falling, the rates for lung disease have been stagnant for a decade.
This means that we urgently need forward thinking donors to stop the needs of people with lung conditions from falling under the radar. If you are a trustee, or have links with a charitable trust, foundation or other voluntary funding body, please consider supporting us.
To find out more about working with us please get in touch today. Thank you.

*We would also like to thank some of our recent trust and foundation donors, Garfield Weston Foundation, PF Charitable Trust, The February Foundation, Boots Charitable Trust, Peacock Charitable Trust, The D’Oyly Carte Charitable Trust, The Steel Charitable Trust and the Masonic Charitable Foundation.*
