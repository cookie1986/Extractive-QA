## Your health and social care champion
We make sure NHS leaders and other decision makers hear your voice and use your feedback to improve care.

## How we help you
Healthwatch is your health and social care champion. If you use GPs and hospitals, dentists, pharmacies, care homes or other support services, we want to hear about your experiences. As an independent statutory body, we have the power to make sure NHS leaders and other decision makers listen to your feedback and improve standards of care. Last year we helped nearly a million people like you to have your say and get the information and advice you need.

## The power of your feedback
We use your feedback to better understand the challenges facing the NHS and other care providers nationally, to make sure your experiences improve health and care services for everyone. We can also help you to get the [information and advice](http://www.healthwatch.co.uk/advice-and-information) and you need to make the right decisions for you and to get the support you deserve.
It’s really important that you share your experiences – whether good or bad, happy or sad. If you’ve had a negative experience, it’s easy to think there’s no point in complaining, and that ‘nothing ever changes’. Or, if you’ve had a great experience, that you ‘wish you could say thank you’. Remember, your feedback is helping to improve people’s lives. So if you need advice, or you’re ready to tell your story – we’re hear to listen.

## Your local Healthwatch
Wherever you live in England, you’ll have a local Healthwatch nearby (there are over 150 across the country). We’re here to listen to the issues that really matter to local communities and to hear about your experiences of using health and social care services. We’re entirely independent and impartial, and any information you share with us is confidential.
