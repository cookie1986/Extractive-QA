### How to hit your target
 
* We know that asking people for money can be tough. We’ve put together some ideas to raise valuable funds without directly asking for sponsorship:
Sell unwanted items on Ebay  
Host a car boot sale  
Sell pre-loved clothes on Vinted  
Suggest donations instead of gifts for your birthday or...'
