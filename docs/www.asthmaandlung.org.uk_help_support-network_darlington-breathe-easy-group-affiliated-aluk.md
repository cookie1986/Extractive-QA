Make new friends who know what you’re going through, and learn more about living with a lung condition.
Breathe Easy Darlington meets at the Copper Beach on the first Tuesday of every month from 12.30pm onwards (for pub lunch, if you’d like one, and a bit of a chat!) We often have a raffle and announcements of any upcoming events or trips and then we have a speaker at 2pm.
We also have our weekly BEActive exercise/dance group with our respiratory trained physio, Victoria. This takes place every Wednesday from 11.45am - 1.45pm at Eastbourne Sports Complex, Bourne Avenue, Darlington, DL1 1LJ , with a refreshments break in the middle. Exercises are tailor-made for those with breathing difficulties and we do as much or as little as we can. No pressure!
In addition to this we have a walking group during the summer months - led by our membership secretary, Malcolm at South Park in Darlington. These take place on the second Tuesday of the month, from May to September inclusive. We meet at 11am at the cafe and walk at a comfortable pace - so do as much or as little as you like, finishing with a cuppa (and maybe cake!) in the cafe.
We have a facebook page where you can find our latest events and access our application form facebook.com/Breatheeasydarlington/
contact us at [breatheeasydarlington@hotmail.com](mailto:breatheeasydarlington@hotmail.com) for more details.
