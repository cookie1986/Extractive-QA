# Information for executors and solicitors
Here’s everything you need to know if you’re acting as the executor of a will with a gift to Asthma + Lung UK.
## What is an executor and what are their duties?
An executor is the person or organisation named in a will who is responsible for carrying out the terms of the will. An executor will usually be a professionally qualified solicitor or an individual who was close to the deceased called a ‘lay executor’.
For more information see our [Legacy glossary](/support-us/leave-gift-your-will/legacy-glossary "Legacy glossary").
## How to pay in a legacy gift to us?
You can send us a cheque to our office using the details below:
Legacies Team  
Asthma + Lung UK  
18 Mansell Street  
London E1 8AA
Or you can send the payment by bank transfer to the following account:
Account name: Asthma and Lung UK  
Bank name: NatWest  
Sort code: 60-80-07  
Account number: 60245980
Please also include a reference of ‘Legacy – (name of deceased)’ to help us identify the gift and acknowledge safe receipt. We would be most grateful if, when making a legacy payment, you could include a note or email to [wills@asthmaandlung.org.uk](mailto:wills@asthmaandlung.org.uk) providing:
* The full name and title of the deceased
* Their previous address (to allow us to update our records)
* The date of death
* Copy of the will
* The executor’s name and contact details (for us to acknowledge receipt)

## Administering a gift
In most cases we would prefer to receive the sale proceeds of property or shares gifted to Asthma + Lung UK in a will. However, each individual case is different, so before taking any action to either transfer or sell the property or shares, please contact us via [legacies@asthmaandlung.org.uk](mailto:legacies@asthmaandlung.org.uk).
## Breathe Easy Groups or Asthma + Lung UK Support Groups
If you’re acting as the executor of a will that includes a gift to a Breathe Easy group or an Asthma + Lung UK support group please email wills@asthmaandlung.org.uk or call 0300 222 5800 so we can put you in touch with the right person.
