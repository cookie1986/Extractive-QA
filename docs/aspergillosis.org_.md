**What We Provide**
Maybe you or a loved one has just received a diagnosis of aspergillosis and you’re not sure where to start. Or maybe you need to share information about your condition with your doctor, carer, housing association or benefits assessor. This website is here to provide patients and carers with everything you need to know about aspergillosis.
**About Us**
This website is edited and maintained by the NHS [**National Aspergillosis Centre**](https://mft.nhs.uk/wythenshawe/services/respiratory-and-allergy/national-aspergillosis-centre/) (NAC) CARES team.
The National Aspergillosis Centre is an NHS highly specialised commissioned service that specialises in the diagnosis and management of [**chronic aspergillosis**](https://aspergillosis.org/cpa/), a serious infection affecting mostly the lungs caused by pathogen species of the fungus *Aspergillus*– mostly*A. fumigatus* but also several other species. NAC accepts **[referrals](https://mft.nhs.uk/wythenshawe/services/respiratory-and-allergy/national-aspergillosis-centre/referrals/)** and requests for advice and guidance from all over the UK.

[Support groups & meetings](https://aspergillosis.org/support-meetings/)
We run a Facebook support group and weekly Zoom meetings which provide a great opportunity to chat with other patients, carers and NAC staff.

[Antifungal drug interactions](https://antifungalinteractions.org/)
This website can be used to check whether any prescription drugs you may be taking will interact with your antifungal medication.

[Blog posts](https://aspergillosis.org/more/)
The blog area has posts on a variety of topics including information on living with aspergillosis, lifestyle & coping skills and research news. 
# What is Aspergillosis?
Aspergillosis is a group of conditions caused by Aspergillus, a species of mould that is found in lots of places all over the world.
**Most of these moulds are harmless**. However, some can cause a variety of diseases ranging from allergic reactions to life-threatening conditions, or both.
## **Aspergillosis rarely develops in healthy individuals**
 Most people breathe in theses spores every day without any issues.
### **Transmission**
You cannot catch aspergillosis from another person or from animals.
**There are 3 forms of Aspergillosis:**

# **Health Notice**
The Aspergillosis Website can be a very useful resource, but of course it cannot replace the vitally important relationship each patient has with their doctor. Nothing mentioned in this website should be taken as medical advice.
# **Support us**
FIT funding enables the National Aspergillosis Centre to host large Facebook groups, such as the National Aspergillosis Centre Support (UK) group and also groups that support their research into Chronic Pulmonary Aspergillosis (CPA) and Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA). This patient participation and involvement is vital for NAC research.
