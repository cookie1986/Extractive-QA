# What are the causes of pulmonary fibrosis?
On this page we explain the different possible causes for pulmonary fibrosis (the scarring of the lungs).
In most types of pulmonary fibrosis, a specific cause cannot be found. The word ‘idiopathic’ means there is no known cause.
In a few cases, it’s possible to identify a specific cause, such as:
* being exposed to certain types of dust - [including wood or metal dusts or asbestos](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/pulmonary-fibrosis/occupational-interstitial-lung-diseases)
* being exposed to allergens carried in the air - [such as bird feathers or mould](#)
* a viral or bacterial infection
* a side effect of a [drug or treatment.](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/pulmonary-fibrosis/drug-induced-pulmonary-fibrosis)
Some types of pulmonary fibrosis are more likely to occur when you have another condition such as rheumatoid arthritis or scleroderma. These are sometimes called [connective tissue disease related ILDs or CT-ILD.](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/pulmonary-fibrosis/autoimmune)
There are lots of different types of pulmonary fibrosis, with different causes. But often there is no known cause.
## Is pulmonary fibrosis hereditary?
In a very few cases, two or more members of a family may develop pulmonary fibrosis. There are many complex ways in which it’s possible to inherit a tendency to pulmonary fibrosis, and not all are well understood.
Current UK data sets suggest that less than 10% of people with pulmonary fibrosis have an inheritable form of the disease. Genetic testing isn’t routinely available for people with pulmonary fibrosis. But there are some rare, but well-known, inheritable conditions that cause pulmonary fibrosis, such as dyskeratosis congenita. If you, or a family member, has one then you may be offered genetic screening.
> Smoking can cause some very specific kinds of pulmonary fibrosis such as desquamative interstitial pneumonia and respiratory bronchiolitis-interstitial lung disease.
