## Your GP
The first thing you should do if you think you may have symptoms of COVID-19 that have lasted longer than four weeks is to speak to your GP. They will assess your symptoms and carry out some tests, to see if there could be any other potential cause. Treatment will be recommended based on the cause of your symptoms.
