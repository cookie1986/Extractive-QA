[Clearing the air in Greater Manchester: we can’t delay the Clean Air Zone](/blog/we-cant-delay-the-clean-air-zone-manchester)

Greater Manchester is one of the most polluted regions in the UK. Air pollution across the region accounts for at least 1,200 premature deaths every year.

Our Policy & Public Affairs Officer, Rob Day, tells us what happened, setting out why this delay is devastating for both residents across Greater Manchester and the wider clean air movement – and what needs to happen to protect everyone in the region with a lung condition.
