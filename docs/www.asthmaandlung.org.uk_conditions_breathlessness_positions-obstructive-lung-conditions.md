# Positions for obstructive lung conditions
In obstructive lung disease, such as COPD, asthma or bronchiectasis it takes longer to empty your lungs. The airflow is slower because the disease makes the airways narrower or the lungs less elastic.
Because breathing out is slower, the person may need to breathe in again before they have emptied their lungs. This is called hyperinflation or gas-trapping and makes breathing uncomfortable.
## Try our suggestions to reduce breathlessness in obstructive lung conditions
### Stand leaning forward
**Stand leaning forward** (figure 1) lean from the hips, with your forearms resting on something at the right height, such as a chair or kitchen work surface.
When you’re out and about, you could lean on a walking stick or a frame with wheels. If you’re shopping, use your supermarket trolley.

### **Sit leaning forward**
**Sit leaning forward**(figure 2): lean resting your elbows on your knees

figure 2### Sit leaning forward at a table
**Sit leaning forward at a table** (figure 3): rest your head and arms on pillows on a table when you’re really short of breath.

figure 3### Side lying with leg on the floor bent at knee
**Lie on your side with pillows under your head** (figure 4). Make sure the top pillow supports your neck. Slightly bend the knee of the leg you are lying on, with your top leg straight. Having your legs apart may also help. This position can help when you’re breathless when you’re resting, such as when your symptoms flare up.
