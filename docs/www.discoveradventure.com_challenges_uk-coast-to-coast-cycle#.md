## About the Challenge
Leaving the west coast we head inland, carving our way over the Cumbrian Mountains and through the Lake District National Park, before crossing into Yorkshire, through the heart of the famous Dales and onto our destination: the East Coast and the historic town of Whitby. Gruelling climbs, magnificent descents and stunning scenery await us!
This is a challenge for the hardy, taking whatever the Lakes and the Dales might throw at us. We will feel a wonderful sense of achievement when we reach the fabulous town of Whitby!

## Itinerary
 ### UK Coast to Coast Cycle
  
 OPEN • 4 DAYS    * [Day 1:    
 Workington to Kendal](#itinerary-body-3085)  Leaving the rugged coastline of the West Coast, we head into the winding lanes that lead us to the foothills of the Cumbrian Mountains. We encounter the challenging Whinlatter Pass standing over 350m above sea level; our first challenge before dropping down into the picturesque town of Keswick. Passing many of the lakes that make this area famous we cycle past Derwent Water, Thirlmere and Windermere as well as riding beneath the slopes of one of England’s highest mountains, Hellvelyn. We plough on to our evening’s destination in Kendal. Here we are rewarded by a hot shower and some wholesome food to replenish our energies ready for our next day in the saddle. Night hotel.
**Cycle approx. 53 miles**
* [Day 2:    
 Kendal to Scotch Corner](#itinerary-body-3086)  After a hearty breakfast we head east, leaving behind the beautiful Lake District and crossing the county boundary into Yorkshire and its stunning Dales. Our route today sees some steep climbs rising to over 300m at the highest point. We pass thorough Sedbergh and Hawes as we snake our way across the beautiful Yorkshire Dales National Park towards Richmond and beyond to Scotch Corner. Night hotel.
 **Cycle approx. 57 miles**
* [Day 3:    
 Scotch Corner to Whitby](#itinerary-body-3087)   Our final day’s ride has a more gentle start before we tackle the Cleveland Hills and North York Moors with 1:3 gradients! We are of course rewarded by fabulous views (on a clear day) across the Moors and down to the Coast, which makes it all worthwhile after all that effort! What better way to end than cycling the last section south along the spectacular coastal road, with some great freewheeling descents into the historic town of Whitby. Home to the infamous Captain Cook and HMS Endeavour, the town makes a fitting finish to a tough but awesome ride. After finishing at the seafront we make our way to the hotel for a well-earned celebration. **Cycle approx. 58 miles**
* [Day 4:    
 Depart Whitby](#itinerary-body-3088)  After breakfast we load up into the waiting transport and transfer back to our cars in Workington. A final goodbye before we all head homeward with tired legs but a glow of deep satisfaction.
N.B. If you haven't left a vehicle parked at Workington you are of course welcome to depart direct from Whitby!

## Challenge Information

### Detailed Information
* [Leaders & Trip Support](#info-body-208)   Your trip will be led by experienced Discover Adventure leaders and support crew, including mechanics. Our leaders are selected for their knowledge and experience, friendliness and approachability, sense of humour and ability to safely and effectively deal with any situation that arises; they are also trained in first aid. The crew will have mobile phones and/or radios where appropriate, medical kit and other safety apparatus where necessary.   
  
The number of crew and support vehicles looking after you will depend on the final size of your group, but the team will be looking after every aspect of your trip whether that’s transporting your luggage, making you lunch and sorting out any mechanical problems. Support vehicles are with the group all of the time, and carry all luggage and spares.   
  
The route will be supplied as a GPX and TCX files and therefore there will be no route marking by way of orange arrows (helping us to reduce our carbon footprint). You will also have access to the the route via Google Maps which will show where your position is relative to the route - therefore helping you get back on track if you go off course. This will also show you the location of upcoming climbs and water-stops.
* [Trip Safety](#info-body-215)  Your safety, and that of the rest of the group, is our highest priority. Our trips are designed and planned with safety in mind. Your crew will be equipped with communication devices (eg phones, radios and/or emergency satellite phones), medical kit and other safety apparatus appropriate to the destination. Our leaders always have access to our 24-hour emergency UK back-up. They are responsible for safety on the trip, and will make any changes to the itinerary they deem necessary, should local conditions dictate. Pre-trip administration - such as medical questionnaires and travel insurance as appropriate - is all done with your safety in mind.
* [Accommodation](#info-body-202)  We usually stay in hotels or lodges of a 2-3\* standard or equivalent. Standards may vary between the hotels but they are generally comfortable and convenient for our route. Hotels are often on the outskirts of towns to minimise unnecessary extra mileage and avoid traffic.
* [Food & Dietary Requirements](#info-body-206)  The food provided is plentiful and will give you plenty of energy. Where lunch is included, it may be a buffet-style lunch-stop, or a packed lunch. Dinners and breakfasts are generally eaten in camp or at our hotel, depending on the trip. Being vegetarian or having other dietary requirements is not usually a problem provided you let us know well in advance. If you know there are plenty of foods you cannot eat you may wish to bring extra snacks from home so you can top up your energy supply.
* [Cancelling your booking](#info-body-321)  In the unfortunate circumstance that you need to cancel your booking, we would ask that you notify us in writing either by post or email.  Your cancellation will be considered effective from the date the notice is received. Registration fees, amendment fees and insurance premiums are non refundable and, depending on your payment option and how close it is to your challenge departure date, you may be liable for a cancellation charge.
Full details of all cancellation charges may be found in the Terms and Conditions of booking.
* [Passenger Portal](#info-body-356)  We have a Passenger Portal which will give you more details of the challenge itself. It also enables you to see any outstanding information we need, the countdown to your challenge departure, see your outstanding balance, make payments and update your contact details. You can access this via the following link - [Passenger Portal Log in](https://secure.discoveradventure.com/passenger-portal/login/?next=/passenger-portal/).

### Preparing for the Challenge
* [Fitness Levels](#info-body-217)  This is designed to be a challenge, and it is vital that you train sufficiently for it. We will supply you with a thorough training guide once you have registered. We expect all participants to train hard in advance, but we respect everyone’s limits and do not expect everyone to maintain the same pace. Inadequate training is likely to have an impact not just on your chances of completing the challenge, but enjoying it too - and we want you to have the time of your life!
Our challenges attract people of all levels of experience, fitness and ability as well as all ages and backgrounds. We design our challenges so that everyone can go at their own pace: this is not a race. If you have concerns about your fitness or if you have reduced mobility please do contact us for a confidential chat about whether this challenge is appropriate for you.
For logistical and safety reasons we sometimes need to re-group, so the front-runners may find themselves waiting for the slower ones. Please relax, and remember that this is a team effort that enables people to achieve their personal goals and earn sponsorship.
* [Clothing & Kit](#info-body-216)  We plan our trips around the optimal weather conditions, but could still be exposed to bad weather at any time. It is vital you are prepared for all conditions. We provide you with a detailed packing kit-list on registration, as well as details on useful discounts you are entitled to as a Discover Adventure customer. We are always available if you need advice.
If you are still to buy some kit don’t forget that Cotswold Outdoor, Snow and Rock, Cycle Surgery and Runners Need offer all Discover Adventure participants **15% off** any purchases you make with them. Please ask us for the code if you do not have this already.
