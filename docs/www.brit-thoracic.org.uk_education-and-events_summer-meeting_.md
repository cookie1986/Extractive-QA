The Summer Meeting will be **onsite only**, as this event emphasises the value of meeting colleagues, sharing experiences and having those one-to-one interactions that can sometimes be missed from online events. While there will be no live online content available from this year’s Meeting, BTS continues to provide an extensive programme of online education via our live Short Courses, the vast majority of which will remain online during 2023.
[Summer Meeting 2023 Programme and Conference Information](/media/456174/bts-summer-meeting-2023-programme-and-conference-information-10323.pdf "BTS Summer Meeting 2023 Programme And Conference Information")
After the event, all delegates who have attended the Meeting will be sent a website link to access video recordings of the main sessions and guest lecture until 22 September 2023.
This year’s Meeting will be held at **University Place, The University of Manchester, M13 9PL**. We were last at University Place 10 years ago, so are looking forward to returning!

 Programme

[Booking conditions](/media/456145/bts-summer-meeting-2023-booking-conditions.pdf "BTS Summer Meeting 2023 Booking Conditions")
**Abstract Prizes** return, with two exciting categories:
“Improving quality and excellence in patient care”
“Improvements in respiratory education and training”
With these Abstract Prizes, we aim to provide a forum for respiratory teams to present, share and discuss the implementation of quality improvement projects and improvements in respiratory education and training. High quality applications from the whole respiratory multi-disciplinary team are welcomed with an emphasis on sharing best practice. By promoting these Abstract Prizes, the Society hopes to learn more about the many innovative schemes that are being developed by our members and others to improve patient care throughout the UK. Short-listed abstracts will be displayed as digital posters at the conference, and will also have a spoken presentation in the programme. Submissions are encouraged from the whole respiratory team.
The **Clinical Grand Round** competition has been one of the highlights of the Summer Meeting programme for many years, and it remains a very closely contested event, which enhances the CV of any specialist trainee, nurse or AHP who is shortlisted and/or wins. The competition is not open to post CCT doctors, but we welcome applications from all other members of the respiratory team, wherever they are based. The best three submissions, as judged by members of the BTS Education and Training Committee, will be shortlisted and the authors invited to present their cases during the Clinical Grand Round symposium at the first day of the Meeting.  
For further information and examples of last years winning and shortlisted abstracts, please see below
