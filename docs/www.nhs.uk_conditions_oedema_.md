# Swollen ankles, feet and legs (oedema)
**Swelling in the ankles, feet or legs often goes away on its own. See a GP if it does not get better in a few days.**
## Common causes of swollen ankles, feet and legs
Swelling in the ankles, feet and legs is often caused by a build-up of fluid in these areas, called oedema.
Oedema is usually caused by:
* standing or sitting in the same position for too long
* eating too much salty food
* being overweight
* being pregnant
* taking certain medicines – such as some blood pressure medicines, contraceptive pills, hormone therapy, antidepressants or steroids
Oedema can also be caused by:
* an injury – such as a [strain or sprain](/conditions/sprains-and-strains/)
* an [insect bite or sting](/conditions/insect-bites-and-stings/)
* problems with your kidneys, liver or heart
* a blood clot
* an infection

## How to ease swelling yourself
Swelling in your ankles, feet or legs should go away on its own, but there are some things you can try to help.
### 
 Do
* raise your legs or the swollen area on a chair or pillows when you can
* get some gentle exercise, like walking, to improve your blood flow
* wear wide, comfortable shoes with a low heel and soft sole
* wash, dry and moisturise your feet to avoid infections
### 
 Don’t
* do not stand or sit for long periods of time
* do not wear clothes, socks or shoes that are too tight
## 
Non-urgent advice: See a GP if:
1 or both of your ankles, foot or legs are swollen and:
* it has not improved after treating it at home for a few days
