## Make tax-efficient donations
### Gift Aid
Make your donation worth 25% more at no extra cost to you.
If you are a UK taxpayer and the amount of income tax or capital gains tax you pay equals, or is more than, the amount of tax we would claim back on your donation, you are eligible to register for Gift Aid. This enables us to receive the equivalent of 25% of your donation back from HMRC.

### Payroll Giving
Payroll Giving is a hassle-free way to regularly donate to Asthma + Lung UK straight from your salary. Your donation will be deducted by your employer directly from your salary, before tax. That means your donation is worth an extra 20%.
Please see our [Payroll Giving](https://www.blf.org.uk/take-action/payroll-giving) page for more details.
### Donate your shares
Donating shares to Asthma + Lung UK is a simple tax-effective way to support our work and reduce your tax bill as such donations can be exempt from Capital Gains Tax and could also reduce your Income Tax liability.
If you only have a few shares that would be uneconomical to sell, you may want to consider sending them to [ShareGift](https://www.blf.org.uk/donate/other-ways-to-donate/sharegift) who specialise in accepting shares of low value and sending the proceeds to your nominated charity.
