# Leave a gift in your will
Over 1/3 of our funding comes from gifts in wills – they’re absolutely critical to our work. Your gift can help us achieve our vision for a world where everyone breathes with healthy lungs.
## The impact you can make
Lung disease is the third biggest cause of death in the UK. Hospital admissions for lung conditions are rising, air pollution is causing new lung conditions and making existing conditions worse, and there is a huge gap in survival between the rich and the poor.
This must change. That’s why Asthma + Lung UK needs your support.
Your legacy gift could help us raise awareness of the seriousness of lung conditions and challenging misconceptions. It will help us to drive more research into lung health, tackling the causes of lung conditions and ensuring people get the support they need. It will help us transform lung health in the UK.
Need some help? Our Gifts in wills team is here to help with any [queries about leaving a gift in your will](https://action.asthmaandlung.org.uk/page/103660/data/1?ea.tracking.id=LegContactAUK).
## 
 Use our free will writing service
Our free will writing service allows you to write or update your will for free either online of face to face with a solicitor. While you’re under no obligation to do so, most people who use the service also choose to leave a gift to Asthma + Lung UK to help us in our work to transform lung health in the UK.

 FAQ
### 
 Do I need a will?
Leaving a will is very important as it allows you take care of your assets, your loved ones and the causes you care about after you’re gone. If you die without leaving a valid will, your assets – or your estate – will be shared according to certain rules that may not have been what you wanted. This is called intestacy.
### 
 What is a legacy gift?
A legacy gift is a donation you leave to a charity, person or organisation in your will.
### 
 What type of gift can I leave?
There are three main types of legacy gifts:
* Residuary legacy: a share of your estate after all other payments have been made.
* Pecuniary legacy: a specific amount, e.g. “£5,000”.
* Specific legacy: a particular item, such as property, antiques, jewellery or shares.
### 
 How do I make a will and what does it cost?
We would always recommend using a solicitor or professional will writer. Individual wills generally cost around £150 and for ‘mirror wills’ (see our [Legacy glossary](/support-us/leave-gift-your-will/legacy-glossary "Legacy glossary") for these terms explained) it’s roughly £250.

### 
 How do I leave a gift in my will to Asthma + Lung UK?
You’ll need our full name, address, and registered charity numbers:
Asthma and Lung UK  
18 Mansell Street  
London E1 8AA
Registered charity in England and Wales (326730), Scotland (SC038415) and Isle of Man (1177)
### 
 What wording should I use to leave a gift in my will?
Your chosen solicitor or professional will writer can help get the wording right for your gift.
To make sure we receive the gift you decide on, whatever that may be, we ask that you use our full name, address, and registered charity numbers:
Asthma and Lung UK  
18 Mansell Street  
London E1 8AA
Registered charity in England and Wales (326730), Scotland (SC038415) and Isle of Man (1177)
### 
 How do I ensure my will is valid?
For your will to be valid you need to make sure it exists on paper – a copy of your will on the computer alone is not enough. It must be signed by you and two witnesses who must be over the age of 18 and cannot be your spouse or civil partner.
### 
 Are there any tax benefits to leaving money to charity in my will?
If you leave something to charity in your will, then it won't count towards the total taxable value of your estate. You can also cut the Inheritance Tax Rate on the rest of your estate from 40% to 36%, if you leave at least 10% of your ‘net estate’ to a charity.
The rules are complex, so to avoid paying more tax than necessary, please contact wills@asthmaandlung.org.uk.
For information about tax on gifts in wills, go to the [HMRC website](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs) (for UK only).
### 
 Can I restrict my gift to a specific area of work?
The best way to ensure that your gift will be of the greatest help to us is to leave a legacy or bequest for our general charitable purposes. This gives us the flexibility we need to continue our varied work and projects. However, we understand that you may want to restrict your gift to be used for a particular condition or area of our work. If so, please contact our Gifts in wills team by calling 0300 222 5800 or emailing [wills@asthmaandlung.org.uk](mailto:wills@asthmaandlung.org.uk) and we’ll talk you through the options and the correct wording.
