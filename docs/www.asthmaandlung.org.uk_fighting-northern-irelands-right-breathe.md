# Fighting for Northern Ireland's Right to Breathe
At some point in our lives, one-in-five people will develop a lung condition. Asthma + Lung UK is the only UK-wide charity looking after the lungs of Northern Ireland and our vision is for a world where we can all breathe with healthy lungs
To improve lives, we need to do five things:
* [Deliver a Clean Air Strategy and Clean Air Bill to reduce air pollution and improve lung health](/northern-ireland-manifesto-prevent-it "Northern Ireland manifesto: Prevent it")
* [Campaign for a smoke-free Northern Ireland by the mid-2030s](/northern-ireland-manifesto-quit-it "Northern Ireland manifesto: quit it")
* [Champion a regional lung screening programme to identify undiagnosed lung conditions and get people the treatment they need](/northern-ireland-manifesto-diagnose-it "Northern Ireland manifesto: diagnose it")
* [Call for a Lung Health Strategy that will ensure the best care for all living with a lung condition.](/northern-ireland-manifesto-treat-it "Northern Ireland manifesto: treat it")
* [Support the Right to Rehab, so that everyone with a lung condition gets the rehabilitation they need.](/northern-ireland-manifesto-live-better-it "Northern Ireland manifesto: live better with it")
There are simple things we can do. And you can pledge to do some of those things below.
