 About remdesivir
Remdesivir is an antiviral medicine that works by stopping the virus that causes coronavirus (COVID-19) from growing and spreading in the body.
It's used to treat early COVID-19 infection and help to prevent more severe symptoms.
You will usually be given remdesivir through a drip in your arm (infusion).
You'll need to have the treatment as soon as possible after you have tested positive for COVID-19 and within 7 days of your symptoms starting.
You'll be given remdesivir in a hospital or at a local centre.
You will only be eligible to have the medicine if you are in the [highest risk group](/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-care-and-treatments-for-coronavirus/treatments-for-coronavirus/).
If you are in the highest risk group you may be sent a letter and a lateral flow test that you can do at home should you develop symptoms of COVID-19. You must [report your COVID-19 lateral flow test result on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result).
If you test positive for COVID-19, are eligible and have reported the result, you will be contacted by the NHS. This will usually be by text, email or phone.
If you have not been contacted within 24 hours of your positive test, but think you are eligible for COVID-19 treatments, call your GP surgery, specialist or 111. They can make an urgent referral if needed.
You will then be assessed (over the phone) to see if remdesivir is right for you. If it's suitable, they'll tell you where to get your treatment, how to get there and how to return home safely. This will usually be by text, email or phone.
