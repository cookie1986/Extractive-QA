## Who is Sidekick for?
Sidekick is a helpline for young carers aged 13 to 18 - and up to 25 for those with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).
 A young carer is someone who looks after a person struggling with an illness, a disability, a mental health issue or a drug/alcohol problem. It could be a parent, grandparent, sibling or family friend.
 It's okay to get in touch if you're not sure if you're a young carer. We're here to help.

## How can Sidekick help you?
As a young carer, you do something positive by helping your mum or dad, sibling or grandparent. But it can feel difficult at times.
 Here are things we can help you with:
 * Listen when things feel tough and offer support.
* Talk through your responsibilities at home and what could help.
* Look up information on how to register as a young carer or where to find support with financial worries.
* Help with making phone calls, filling out forms or speaking to professionals.
* Support you with relationship worries with friends or family.
 You can ask us anything you like - it will be confidential and there will never be any judgement from us.

## Confidentiality promise
This service is confidential - meaning we won't tell anyone else about the things you tell us. But, sometimes, we may need to share information if we're worried about your safety, or the safety of someone else.
These are the times we might need to tell someone what you've told us:
 * If you tell us you are being hurt - physically or emotionally.
* If another person is being hurt - physically or emotionally.
* If you or someone else is in danger.
* If an adult is having an inappropriate relationship with you or another young person.
 We will always try to work with you to help you get the support you need, from people around you.
