For parents and families of children with CF we can put you in touch with a trained parent volunteer who can share their experience of life with a child who has cystic fibrosis through our [CF Connect scheme](https://www.cysticfibrosis.org.uk/life-with-cystic-fibrosis/support-available/cf-connect-peer-support).
