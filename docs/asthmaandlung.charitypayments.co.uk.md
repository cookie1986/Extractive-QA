#### Why the extra 0.34p?
 The draw takes place every week and there can be **4 or 5 draws
 per month** depending on where the
 dates fall within a calendar month.
 If you do not have enough credit at the time of a draw,
 your number will not be entered.
 
 To help prevent you missing out on any draws in a **5 week
 month** we take an extra
 **£0.34** per entry each month.
 This extra **£0.34** per entry is built up to a full
 **£1** to
 cover instances when there are 5 draws in a month.
