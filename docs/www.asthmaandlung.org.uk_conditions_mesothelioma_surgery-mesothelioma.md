# Surgery for mesothelioma
On this page we cover the different types of surgery that are used to treat mesothelioma.
There’s a lot of medical debate about surgery to treat mesothelioma. Different approaches are taken in different countries around the world.
An operation to remove the whole lung and [pleural membrane](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/mesothelioma/what-is-it#pleura) is called an **extra-pleural pneumonectomy**. A study looking into this form of surgery found that surgery offers limited benefits and potentially causes harm. Because of this, this surgery isn’t offered in the UK anymore.
A less extensive operation to remove as much tumour as possible, but to leave your lung behind is called an extended **pleurectomy** and **decortication**. Doctors are still trying to find out whether this procedure is beneficial. This surgery isn’t a standard treatment in the UK, but it is [being investigated in clinical trials](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/find-a-clinical-trial/a-trial-looking-at-surgery-for-mesothelioma-mars-2).
### Other treatments for mesothelioma:
* [Chemotherapy](/conditions/mesothelioma/chemotherapy-mesothelioma "Chemotherapy for mesothelioma")
* [Radiotherapy](/conditions/mesothelioma/radiotherapy-mesothelioma "Radiotherapy for mesothelioma")
* [Palliative care](/conditions/mesothelioma/palliative-care-mesothelioma "Palliative care for mesothelioma")
* [Treating pleural effusion](/conditions/mesothelioma/treating-pleural-effusion "Treating pleural effusion")
