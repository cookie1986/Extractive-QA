 I'd like to add a little extra to help cover fees. 
 **Gift Aid** - Boost your donation with a Gift Aid contribution for every £1 you donate.  

I confirm I am a UK taxpayer and understand if I pay less income tax and/or capital gains in the current year than the amount of gift aid claimed on my donations, it’s my responsibility to pay the difference. I would like to treat future donations and any in the past 4 years as gift aid donations, until I notify you.   
**If this donation is on behalf of someone else, we are unable to claim Gift Aid.**

 I’m running the Royal Parks Half Marathon in memory of my wonderful dad!
I very recently lost my dad very suddenly whilst on holiday with him. Although he had been diagnosed with IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), there was no sign that he had deteriorated so badly until he ended up in ICU. I was very lucky to enjoy a delicious Thai meal with him and a couple of beers only 72 hours before him leaving us. This charity is now very close to my heart. Every minute, someone in the UK is diagnosed with lung disease. I want to make a difference. I'm running the Royal Parks Half Marathon for Asthma + Lung UK, the only UK charity that fights for everyone’s right to breathe. Every pound I'm able to raise will take us a step closer to a world where everyone has healthy lungs and no one has to loose their life from a lung disease! I owe this to my dad. 
Just £22 allows one of Asthma + Lung UK's nurses to answer a call on the Helpline, offering potentially lifesaving advice. I'd be very grateful for any donations you could make!
