    Many of the businesses listed on our website include different information on accessibility. There are filters within our business search - so you can see only businesses that have (for example) level access or support British Sign Language.
 ### What is an accessibility guide?
 This is a detailed breakdown of facts and figures information on what visiting this venue will be like - it covers access to the building, access inside such as lifts and stairs, and what staff support is available.
 We offer access to two different access guides where available.
 1. [AccessAble detailed access guides](https://www.accessable.co.uk/pages/about-accessibility-guides "AccessAble detailed access guides")
2. [Accessibility guides created by the businesses themselves (example)](https://www.accessibilityguides.org/content/example-attraction "Accessibility guides created by the businesses themselves (example)")
 Accessibility guides are updated regularly so you can have the information you need before you visit.
 ### How can I use the accessibility guides?
 We're working with partners to create more accessibility guides for businesses across Scotland.
 1. Search for the type of business you want
2. Within the filters, look under facilities and select accessibility
3. Select access guides
4. You'll see all of the businesses with an access guide in the search results
 OR
 1. Find the individual business you want to visit
2. Under contact details and opening hours, you'll find the Access Guide if one exists
3. Click on the guide to open it and find the full information
