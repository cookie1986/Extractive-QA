# Funeral giving
Many families choose to celebrate the life of a loved one by making a donation in their memory. Frequently, these donations are collected at the funeral service, sometimes instead of floral tributes.
To make the process of collecting donations as simple as possible for you, we can provide you with materials in advance.
You can request the following from us prior to a service, get in touch with us by emailing donations@asthmaandlung.org.uk.
* pew collection envelopes
* Gift Aid forms — we are able to claim 25p from Inland Revenue for every £1 donated with completed Gift Aid forms
## Posting donations to us
Please make cheques payable to Asthma + Lung UK
Please use the following address:
Asthma + Lung UK

London

## Saying thank you to families
We would love to express our gratitude to the deceased’s family for thinking of us during this time. If you provide us with the name of the next of kin and their relationship to the deceased, we will be able to write to personally thank them for their generosity. At this current time, the processing of any donations made by post may be delayed. This means that our thank you letters may also take a little longer than usual to arrive, we thank you for your patience during this time.
You can find out more about how we look after data in our [privacy policy](/about-us/policies "Policies").
