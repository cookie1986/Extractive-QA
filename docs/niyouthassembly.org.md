 We spent last Friday quizzing the outgoing @nichildcom reflecting on the past 8 years of her work.  
  
Thank you @ShriekingGreek for supporting the Youth Assembly, and for promoting and advancing the rights of children and young people here. We wish you every success for the future.

 In the Assembly public gallery listening to the @nichildcom answering questions from the @NIYouthAssembly on her time in office. 8 years of dedication, passion and often challenge providing a voice for Children and Young People striving to effect and deliver change.

 Northern Ireland's @nichildcom Commissioner @ShriekingGreek addresses the @NIYouthAssembly, highlighting some of what has been achieved during her time in office. Having worked with @ShriekingGreek as an MLA & Minister, her dedication, commitment & tenacity will be missed.
