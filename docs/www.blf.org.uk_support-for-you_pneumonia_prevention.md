# How do you prevent pneumonia?
There are some things you can do to reduce your risk of pneumonia. These are important to follow even if you have had pneumonia before, to stop you from getting it again.
On this page:
* [Get vaccinated](#vaccinated)
* [Get help to stop smoking](#stop-smoking)
* [Practise good hygiene](#hygiene)
* [Avoid drinking too much alcohol](#alcohol)
## Get vaccinated
There are [two types of vaccine available for bacterial pneumonia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/pneumococcal-vaccination/). They protect against the most common cause of pneumonia, the bacterium *Streptococcus pneumoniae*.
* The **pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV)** is for people over 65 and anyone over the age of two in a [high-risk group.](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/when-is-pneumococcal-vaccine-needed/) This includes people with diseases like [COPD](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/copd/what-is-copd) or [severe asthma](https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/severe-asthma). Most people only need to have this vaccine once. If you have a condition that affects your spleen or kidneys, you may need a vaccination every five years.
* The **pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV)**, also known by the brand name **Prevenar 13**, is given to babies by the NHS. Babies get their first dose when they’re twelve weeks old and a booster when they’re one year old. It’s also available for adults privately from pharmacies.
You can also reduce your risk of viral pneumonia by getting the [flu jab](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/flu-influenza-vaccine/) and the [COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/coronavirus/coronavirus-vaccine).
> ### The flu jab is currently offered free to people who:
> 
> 
> * are 50 and over
> * are aged two or three years
> * are in primary school (reception to year 6)
> * are in year 7 to year 9 of secondary school
> * have certain health conditions, including breathing conditions such as COPD, IPF and uncontrolled asthma
> * are pregnant
> * are in long-stay residential care
> * receive a carer's allowance
> * are the main carer for an older or disabled person who may be at risk if you get sick
> * live with someone with a weakened immune system, from a health condition, a transplant or certain treatments
> * are frontline health or social care workers.
> 
To find out more about getting a pneumonia, flu, or COVID-19 vaccine, talk to your GP or call our helpline on **0300 222 5800**.
## Get help to stop smoking
Smokers are more likely to get pneumonia as well as other chest infections. Children whose parents smoke are also at a higher risk of getting pneumonia.
[Find out more on stopping smoking](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/smoking)
## Practise good hygiene
Common winter viral infections increase the risk of pneumonia, so you should practise good hygiene to reduce the spread of germs. For example, you should:
* cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze
* throw away used tissues straight away
* wash your hands often.
## Avoid drinking too much alcohol
[Drinking too much alcohol](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/alcohol-misuse/) weakens your immune system, making you more at risk of infections, including pneumonia.
