* **Type 2 diabetes is a common condition** that causes the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood to become too high.
* **It can cause symptoms like excessive thirst, needing to pee a lot and tiredness**. It can also increase your risk of getting serious problems with your eyes, heart and nerves.
* **It's a lifelong condition that can affect your everyday life**. You may need to change your diet, take medicines and have regular check-ups.
* **It's caused by problems with a chemical in the body (hormone) called insulin**. It's often linked to being overweight or inactive, or having a family history of type 2 diabetes.
