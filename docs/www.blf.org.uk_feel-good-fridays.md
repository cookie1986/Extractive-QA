# Feel Good Fridays
Feel Good Fridays are our chair based Zumba sessions with Anne Little designed to be fun, improve mobility and general well being.
The sessions take place on Zoom every Friday from 10.30am to 11.15am. Contact us via [supportgroups@asthmaandlung.org.uk](mailto:supportgroups@asthmaandlung.org.uk) or 0300 222 5800 to find out how to register for these sessions.
Our instructor Anne Little has been teaching chair dance classes for older adults and those with limited movement for around 7 years.
"The laughter and smiles we see at our Feel Good Friday sessions are a joy to behold! Our ladies and gents love the banter and the music. They always say they feel energised after the classes. What’s more, they feel comfortable to dance at a level that feels just right for them that day. These sessions are so rewarding to teach. They're a real tonic for all concerned - teachers and participants. As one of our ladies said recently ‘…chair ZUMBA makes me feel on top of the world…!’" Anne
Watch our beneficiaries explain how much they love these sessions
 
 
> I have thoroughly enjoyed them. Each session improved my mood and my energy levels, Anne Little is fabulous, she connects so well and makes the 45 minute exercise session so enjoyable."
