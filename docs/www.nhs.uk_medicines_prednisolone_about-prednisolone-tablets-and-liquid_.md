 About prednisolone tablets and liquid
Prednisolone is a medicine used to treat a wide range of health problems including allergies, blood disorders, skin diseases, inflammation, infections and certain cancers and to prevent organ rejection after a transplant.
It helps by reducing swelling (inflammation) and can also calm down your immune system. This helps autoimmune conditions, like [rheumatoid arthritis](/conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/), where your immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues.
Prednisolone is a [steroid](/conditions/steroids/) or corticosteroid medicine. Corticosteroids are not the same as anabolic steroids.
Prednisolone is available only on prescription as tablets and as a liquid you swallow. It can also be given by injection but this is usually only done in hospital.
## Key facts
* It's best to take prednisolone tablets or liquid once a day in the morning so it does not keep you awake.
* The most common side effects are problems sleeping, weight gain and indigestion.
* Taking prednisolone can make you more likely to get infections. Tell your doctor if you get an infection, such as coronavirus (COVID-19), or if you're exposed to infectious illnesses like [chickenpox](/conditions/chickenpox/), [shingles](/conditions/shingles/) or [measles](/conditions/measles/).
* If you take prednisolone for more than 3 weeks, or you're on a high dose, you'll get a blue steroid card. You may also need to carry a (red) steroid emergency card. Ask your pharmacist or doctor about both of these.
* You will need to carry a steroid emergency card if you take dexamethasone to treat Addison’s disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, other adrenal problems, adrenal insufficiency or hypothalamic or pituitary disorder. Do not stop taking prednisolone if you're taking it for these conditions.
* Do not stop taking prednisolone suddenly if you've been on it for more than 3 weeks or have taken high doses (more than 40mg) for more than 1 week. This can cause withdrawal side effects.
