## Getting help is the first step
Talking to somebody about your drug or alcohol problem is the first step to resolving your problems. You can call DAN 24/7 on 0808 808 2234 anytime day or night and we will give you help and advice.
If you’d rather look for an agency online then you can search through our online database of drug and alcohol agencies where you can find National and Local agencies that will be able to help you.
Remember, anything you tell DAN 24/7 or any agency you contact is confidential and you won’t even need to give your real name.
