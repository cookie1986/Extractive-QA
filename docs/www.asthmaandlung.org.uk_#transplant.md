### 
 Why we're here
### 
 We believe that every breath matters
Whoever said, “We all breathe the same air” didn’t have to worry about being one of the 36,000 early deaths attributed to air pollution every year. Wasn’t the 1 in every 5 people who will have a lung condition in their lifetime. Or one of the 5.4 million people in the UK living with asthma.
### 
 Respiratory care isn’t good enough
Even before COVID-19, NHS hospital admissions for lung conditions were rising three times faster than average admissions. People living with lung conditions are often overlooked and being left behind. Their condition isn’t accurately diagnosed at an early stage – and even when they are diagnosed, they’re not given the care they need.
### 
 Transforming lung health
Our vision is for a world where everyone has healthy lungs. We are dedicated to helping create a world where good lung health and the ability to breathe freely are a basic right enjoyed by all. From research and campaigning to advice and support, as the nation’s lung charity we are on a mission to change the way that lung health is perceived.
