 Support service for Black women
 
 
This new service provides extra care for Black and Black Mixed Heritage people in the UK. We know that Black women experience higher risks of complications during pregnancy, which is why we are offering extra support.
We want you to feel empowered and in control during your pregnancy.  
## Remember...
Don’t wait until the next day if you are concerned about your baby’s movements. Contact your GP, midwife or EPU immediately.
