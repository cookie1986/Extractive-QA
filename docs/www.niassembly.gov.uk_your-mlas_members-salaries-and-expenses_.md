# Members' Salaries and Expenses
**Synopsis:** Members' salaries and expenses are provided for under the terms of the Assembly Members (Salaries and Expenses) Determination (Northern Ireland) 2016 as amended by the Assembly Members (Salaries and Expenses) (Amendment) Determination (Northern Ireland) 2020. This Determination is the basis on which Members are provided with the necessary resources to carry out their functions as a Member. It establishes the level of travel allowances that will be paid to Members, enables Members to pay staff, and also to recover the costs incurred in running a constituency office to provide services to constituents such as purchasing equipment, rent, rates, utilities and other operating costs.
The detail of Members' salaries and expenses paid each year can be accessed from the links below.

Following the Assembly Election in 2017 an Executive was not appointed and there was a reduced level of Assembly business. During this period amendments were made to the 2016 Determination by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland exercising powers conferred on that office by the Northern Ireland Assembly Members (Pay) Act 2018. Following the appointment of the Executive on 11 January 2020, the full provisions of the 2016 Determination were restored and these Determinations ceased to have effect.
