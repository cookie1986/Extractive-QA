## The Ultra Challenge Experience
 
![](https://www.ultrachallenge.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ULTRA_CHALLENGE_BOOT2glow-350-300x208.png) 
 Endurance events for a wide range of fitness & ages. Choose your Challenge – do it at your pace, and there’re 14 events in the Series. Our support enables you to go further, whilst enjoying the great outdoors & camaraderie. There’re marquee rest stops, lots of food & drink, medical & massage teams, with a fully signed route to guide you. A big finish-line celebration awaits with an amazing sense of achievement, and once the aches subside you’ll feel energised, and up for more of life’s real challenges! 
Before your Challenge
Good preparation & smart planning are key, and from the moment you sign up you’ll have access to our Challenge App – with training guides, optional training walks, maps, online forums, and the latest news & updates.
Covered Rest Stops
Rest Stops every ~12.5 km with ‘major’ ones every ~25 km, and are much more than the shaky gazebo with water that you see on some events. We’ve marquee cover, large medical & welfare tents, catering services, seating areas for recovery, changing rooms, and a friendly welcome!
Signed Route & Tracking
There’re pink arrows to guide you, distance markers, glow-sticks at night, hazard signs, and a route map in the App. Our ‘Trek Masters’ organise group departures at night so nobody has to walk solo. Our chip timing system enables our Control Room, and your friends / family, to track your progress through the Rest Stops. There’s also the option to hire a ‘GEO TRACKER’ – so they can follow you in real time every step of the way – day & night!
Free Food & Drink
Keeping you well fed & hydrated is key. We pride ourselves on the quantity & quality of our catering, and whichever distance you are on – meals, snacks & drinks are included – so no need to carry much!
* Snacks & drink stops every 12.5 km
* Snacks – from the healthy to treats
* Main meals / hot food every 25 km
* Energy drinks
* All dietary requirements catered for
* Lighter options for ‘runners’
* Finishers meal
Camping Packages
We generally have a ~50 km campsite for rest & sleep if you’re on the 2 day ‘Daylight’ 100 km option, or if you finish / start a 50 km ‘half’ Challenge. Book an inclusive package or ‘pitch your own’ – there’re showers and chill out areas.
Medics, Podiatrists, Massage
We’ve experienced Doctors, Paramedics, First Aiders, Podiatrists, and Massage Teams at Rest Stops. There’re ‘Self Help’ areas with blister plasters, talc, Vaseline, and tape if you want to patch your own feet. Our mobile Emergency Medical Teams are only a phone call away, via our 24 hour Control Room
Medal, T Shirt, Glass of Fizz
We don’t want you to forget that finish-line moment – our Cheer Squad will ensure you won’t! You’ll get a medal, finisher’s T-shirt, and a glass of fizz, before heading to a finishers meal and a well earned rest. Download your official Challenge certificate when you’re ready.
Shuttle Buses & Transfers
There’re shuttles to local train stations for onward travel, and most finish lines have parking so supporters can meet you. We’ve bus ‘transfers’ to / back to key venues (eg the start) – and check out the ‘Bookable Extras’ for details of all transport options.
