Air pollution harms everybody, but it’s especially harmful if you have asthma. Around two-thirds of people with asthma tell us poor air quality makes their asthma worse, putting them at risk of an asthma attack.

Air pollution can irritate your airways. It can also make your asthma symptoms like coughing, wheezing, breathlessness and chest tightness worse. This means you may need to use your reliever inhaler more.

Manage your asthma well. This means taking your preventer medicines every day as prescribed, even if you feel well.
Be prepared by checking the pollution forecast in your area with DEFRA’s UK-wide forecasts.
If you can, avoid pollution hotspots like main roads, junctions, bus stations, and car parks. Try to use quieter back streets as much as possible or go out earlier before pollution levels increase.
Always keep your reliever inhaler (usually blue) with you, so that you can use it to quickly treat asthma symptoms in an emergency.
See your GP if you’re getting symptoms or using your reliever inhaler (usually blue) more than three times a week.
