Hormones involved in processes like periods and pregnancy, such as oestrogen and progesterone, can be asthma triggers.

It’s not yet clear why this is. It could be because they increase inflammation in the body and affect the airways.

When is your asthma most likely to be affected by female hormones?

You're more likely to notice worse symptoms around times of hormonal change like puberty, periods, pregnancy and perimenopause (the time leading up to menopause).

One third of women report worse asthma symptoms before or during a period
Some women, particularly those with severe asthma, have worse symptoms during pregnancy. Although many women notice an improvement or no change at all when they’re pregnant.

Asthma symptoms can get worse during perimenopause (the time leading up to the menopause) 
“Female hormones can be an asthma trigger in their own right,” says Dr Andy Whittamore, our in-house GP. “But they can also make you more sensitive to other triggers, such as hay fever or colds and flu. If you need to use your reliever inhaler three or more times a week, see your GP or asthma nurse. They can help you get back in control of your symptoms.”

The best way to lower your risk from asthma triggers, including female hormones, is to manage your asthma well.

Taking your preventer medicine every day as prescribed, so you’re less likely to react to any asthma triggers, having an asthma review at least once a year to check on your medicines and update your asthma action plan, keeping a symptom diary to help you know what’s triggering your asthma, including hormones.
