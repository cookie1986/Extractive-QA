You cannot be sure how you’ll react to drugs, even if you have taken them before.

Most recreational drugs are unregulated, so you will never know what’s really in them or how strong they are. Misusing prescription medicines can also be very dangerous.

Most recreational drugs can be addictive, and they can all cause a wide range of side effects that impact your physical and mental health.

Staying safe

The best way to look after your asthma is to avoid taking recreational drugs altogether. However, we know that this isn’t always the case, so it’s important that you know how to stay safe.
