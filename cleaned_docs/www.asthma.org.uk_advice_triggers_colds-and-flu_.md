## How can colds and flu trigger asthma attacks?
Colds and flu are the top trigger for people with asthma, with 75% of people with asthma saying their symptoms get worse when they have a cold or the flu. Having a cold or the flu alongside asthma also puts you at risk of an asthma attack that could be life-threatening.
When you have a cold or the flu, your airways become more inflamed and you produce more mucus. This means there’s less room for the air to get through which can make it harder to breathe. This can then trigger your asthma symptoms.
Use our coronavirus symptoms checker to recognise the symptoms of coronavirus, asthma, hay fever, cold and flu.

## How can I reduce my risk of catching a cold or the flu if I have asthma?
1. Wash your hands frequently to reduce the risk of catching a cold or the flu.
2. Take care to avoid sharing towels, cups or other household items with someone who may have a cold.
3. Try not to touch your eyes or nose.
4. Look after yourself: get plenty of sleep and try to reduce your stress levels.
5. Get the flu vaccine. If you have a preventer inhaler, or you have been admitted to hospital because of your asthma, you can get the flu jab on the NHS. Find out more about ___LINK_REMOVED___.

## How can I reduce my risk of an asthma attack if I have a cold or the flu?
1. If you’ve got a preventer inhaler, take it every day, as prescribed. This helps to control inflammation in your lungs, which reduces the risk of having an asthma attack. ___LINK_REMOVED___.
2. Carry your reliever inhaler with you - it’s usually blue. See your GP, pharmacist or asthma nurse if you:
* need to take your reliever inhaler three or more times a week
* have asthma symptoms three or more times a week
* wake up one night a week because of your asthma symptoms.
3. Keep your medicines close, so you can reach them if you're ill in bed - you still need to take your preventer inhaler as prescribed.
4. Don't ignore your symptoms, especially if you feel breathless or wheezy - you might think it's 'just a cold', but remember it could trigger a potentially life-threatening asthma attack.
5. Rest at home. Take paracetamol for aches and pains and drink lots of water to avoid getting dehydrated. Flu especially can really wipe you out, so don’t try to do too much too soon.
6. Book an ___LINK_REMOVED___ with your doctor or asthma nurse. Ask them to update ___LINK_REMOVED___, as this can help you stay well.
