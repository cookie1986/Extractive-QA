## icon  member area Membership
Membership with the ARTP lets you be part of an organisation working towards a common goal of promoting and improving respiratory physiology. Members are able to take up volunteer opportunities within the organisation to help provide resources, information and education to our profession. Members are informed of developments, new technologies and professional guidelines. Members can build a network of other professionals to discuss common interests and similar concerns. Our members demonstrate a willingness to conduct respiratory physiology work at the "gold star" standard and have access to opportunities for career development.

## icon  standards Standards
ARTP Standards aim to drive service development, promote excellent practice and help guide changes which influence and transform the way Respiratory and Sleep physiology services  
operate. The Standards committee aim to address a range of issues, including but not limited to laboratory accreditation (IQIPS), standard operating procedures (SOPs), manufacturers liaison, current clinical practice guidelines, national and international consultations on best practice from organisations such as NICE, ARTP surveys and reports. The committee also supports research and innovation, develops service standards for departments throughout the UK and works collaboratively with other organisations such as the British Lung Foundation, providing expert advice and support with regards to Respiratory and Sleep Physiology.

## icon  research Research and Innovation
ARTP Research and Innovation aim to raise standards in research within healthcare science. We aim to encourage members to develop research skills and contribute towards evidence based practice. The committee is dedicated to supporting researchers at all levels regarding research projects, protocols, applications for ethical approval and possible sources of funding.
Our aim is to continue to produce up to date courses and E-learning guides to cover all aspects involved in producing and publishing research. This will include topics such as how to apply for ethical approval, appropriate statistical tests to use and abstract and poster creation.

Many people in the UK are affected by lung disease, this could be anything from mild asthma to something more serious like lung cancer. ARTP understand that it is important for those burdened by lung disease to have access to good quality, accurate information about their condition, from diagnosis to treatment. The pages in this section should explain what investigations are available in the UK to aid in your diagnosis, and to help monitor your treatment.
