 The cycle of anxiety and breathlessness
 
 
## 
 Is it anxiety or breathlessness?
It can be easy to confuse anxiety symptoms with lung symptoms like breathlessness.
Talk to your GP or nurse about your symptoms as soon as you can. They can support you with any stress or anxiety you’re experiencing. At the same time, they can talk about ways to manage your breathlessness.
Always carry your reliever inhaler (rescue inhaler) with you. This means you can use it straight away if you get symptoms. 
## Panic attacks
A panic attack is a sudden and extreme attack of anxiety. Panic attacks are when your feelings of anxiety get worse suddenly.  
In a panic attack you can get a lot of physical symptoms very quickly. For example, your heart might beat more quickly, or you may feel sweaty, sick, or shaky. You might feel you are short of breath.
