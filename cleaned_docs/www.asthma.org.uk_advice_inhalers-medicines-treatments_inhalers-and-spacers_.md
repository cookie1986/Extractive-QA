 ___LINK_REMOVED___
 
 The way asthma is treated depends on symptoms. Sometimes you may need extra asthma medicines. Different treatment pathways are recommended for adults, for children aged 5-16, and for children under five. But in all cases the goal is to make sure asthma is as well managed as it can be, using the lowest doses of asthma medicine possible.
