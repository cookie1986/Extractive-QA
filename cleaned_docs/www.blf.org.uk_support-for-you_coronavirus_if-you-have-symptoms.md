If you have COVID-19 symptoms or you’ve tested positive for COVID-19, you should try to stay home and avoid contact with other people.
## Recovering at home
If you have mild symptoms of coronavirus, these can normally be treated safely at home. It can help to:
* get a lot of rest
* drink plenty of water
* take paracetamol or ibuprofen if you can, to ease symptoms
* keep warm.
You should also make sure you:
* have enough of your medicines for your lung condition and continue to take them as prescribed
* stay in touch with family, friends, and neighbours and ask for help if you need it
* if you live alone, ask someone to check on you regularly if possible. You can talk on the phone too.
The NHS has advice on how to ___LINK_REMOVED___. We have advice for ___LINK_REMOVED___.  
 
## 
 Make sure you keep taking your usual medicines
It is very important to keep taking your usual medicines, and not to change any doses. You should also continue to follow your self-management plan or ___LINK_REMOVED___.
## When to call NHS 111 or 999
## 
 Call NHS 111 or contact your GP if:
* the symptoms of your lung condition get worse
* you’re feeling more unwell or more breathless
* you find it hard to breathe when you stand up or move around
* you feel very weak, achy or tired
* you feel shivery or shaky
* you have no appetite.
##

* you can’t say short sentences when you’re resting your breathing suddenly gets worse
* you’re having an asthma attack and your reliever inhaler isn’t helping or you’re struggling to breathe
* you cough up blood
* you feel cold and sweaty, and your skin is pale and blotchy
* you have a rash that does not fade when you roll a glass over it
* you collapse or faint
* you feel distressed, confused or very drowsy

## If you have a pulse oximeter
If you live with a lung condition such as pulmonary fibrosis, you may already have a ___LINK_REMOVED___ at home. They are used to measure your blood oxygen levels.
If you have COVID-19 and you’re at higher risk of becoming seriously ill, your GP or healthcare professional may ask you to monitor your oxygen levels. If you don’t have a pulse oximeter at home, the ___LINK_REMOVED___ for you if you test positive for COVID- 19. You can also buy them online or in pharmacies.   
 
## Treatments for people at highest risk
Vaccination has reduced most people’s risk of serious illness from COVID-19.      
Treatments are available to people still at the highest risk.  
This includes people aged 12 or over who:
* have lung cancer
* are on chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or have been within the last year
* have had a cancer tumour removed within the last three months
* have had a lung transplant
* are on biologics or have been in the last six months
* are on steroid tablets for at least 28 days before their positive test result
* are taking medicines which can weaken the immune system, including:
	+ mycophenolate mofetil
	+ oral tacrolimus
	+ azathioprine
	+ mercaptopurine
	+ methotrexate
	+ ciclosporin.
  
If you’re caring for someone, or you have a carer, it’s a good idea to plan how you will manage if one of you becomes unwell. Carers UK have ___LINK_REMOVED___.
### How to get COVID-19 treatments
If you are eligible for COVID-19 treatments and test positive, ___LINK_REMOVED___. If you can’t report your result online, you can call 119 for free. Once you have reported your positive result, the NHS will call you to check if you can have the COVID-19 treatment.
The NHS will usually arrange for delivery of the medicine, or it can be collected by a friend or family member. Some treatments are given in a hospital or health centre through a drip. If you need one of these treatments, the NHS can give you advice on where to go and how to get there and back safely.
## 
 If you have not been contacted
If you think you’re eligible for treatments but you have not been contacted with 24 hours of your positive test, call your GP surgery, specialist or NHS 111.
If you test negative but still have symptoms, you need to do three rapid lateral flow tests over three days and report a positive test if you get one.
### What treatment will I get?
The treatments currently available to eligible people are:
* ___LINK_REMOVED___
* ___LINK_REMOVED___
* ___LINK_REMOVED___
* ___LINK_REMOVED___
These treatments reduce people’s risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19.
The NHS will advise which of these treatments is suitable for you, depending on your condition. Some can be taken at home as tablets or capsules.
Others are given through a drip in your arm, usually at a local hospital or health centre. You'll be told where to go for treatment and how to get there and home safely.  
 
### PANORAMIC trial
Some antiviral medicines to treat coronavirus are also available more widely through a trial being run by the University of Oxford (___LINK_REMOVED___). The trial is open to people in the UK who:
* have tested positive for COVID-19 using a PCR or lateral flow test
* have COVID-19 symptoms that started within the last 5 days
* are aged 50 and over or are aged 18 and over with a health condition that puts them at higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19. This includes people with long-term lung conditions like COPD, IPF and severe asthma.

Even if you’re eligible for COVID-19 treatments, you still need to have all your covid vaccines to lower your risk.   
 
## If you’re not better after four weeks
Recovery from coronavirus is different for everyone. Many people feel better in a few days or weeks, but for some people, recovery takes longer. Your symptoms may change over time, or you may start getting new symptoms.
How long it takes to recover isn’t always linked to how bad your symptoms were when you first got COVID-19.  If you’ve had symptoms for less than four weeks, you’re still at the early stage of infection.
If your COVID-19 symptoms have lasted for more than four weeks, you might have Long COVID.  We have more support for people living with ___LINK_REMOVED___. We also have ___LINK_REMOVED___.
