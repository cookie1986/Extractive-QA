## What’s the best way to lower my risk from COVID-19?
The best way to lower your risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19 is by getting your vaccines.  The NHS has more information about ___LINK_REMOVED___.
It’s also a good idea to get your ___LINK_REMOVED___, because you’re more likely to become seriously ill if you get flu and COVID-19 at the same time.  The flu vaccine is free for people with lung conditions. This includes anyone with asthma using a steroid inhaler or taking steroid tablets.  
Getting the ___LINK_REMOVED___ will also lower your chances of having pneumonia and COVID-19 at the same time. This can lower your risk of becoming seriously ill.
It’s safe to have the flu, pneumonia and COVID- 19 vaccines at the same time, but you may need to book them separately.
If you smoke, the best thing to do for your health is ___LINK_REMOVED___. Quitting smoking is one of the best ways to protect yourself from viral infections, including coronavirus.
COVID-19 spreads when people with the virus breathe, speak, cough or sneeze and release droplets containing the virus into the air.  You can help reduce your risk of getting COVID-19 by: 
* meeting people outside where possible
* letting fresh air in by opening doors and windows if you’re meeting people inside where possible
* washing your hands regularly, using soap and water or hand sanitiser
* cleaning surfaces in your home often, especially if they are touched a lot.
## Should I wear a face covering?
Face coverings, when worn correctly, can reduce the spread of COVID-19.   
Although face masks and coverings are not a legal requirement, there may be some places where you’re asked to wear one, such as hospitals or at your GP surgery.
You might also want to wear a face mask when:  
* you’re meeting someone who is at high-risk from COVID-19
* you’re meeting people in crowded spaces when other cold and flu virus rates are high, such as in winter.
If you have a lung condition, you might want to wear a face covering more often, such as when you are in shops, on public transport, or in other indoor or crowded places.  You could also ask people to wear a face covering if you’re meeting them inside.
Most people with a lung condition, even if it’s severe, can manage to wear a face mask for a short period of time.  Wearing a mask does not reduce a person’s oxygen supply or cause a build-up of carbon dioxide.
Some people wear a ___LINK_REMOVED___ badge to help others understand that they still prefer to social distance.  
 
## Going to work
Your employer must protect your health and safety at work. There are ___LINK_REMOVED___ in place to protect everyone at work.  
If you’re worried about your health and safety at work, you should speak with your employer about your concerns. To help you feel safer, you may also want to:
* speak to your employer about changing your working hours so you can travel on public transport at quieter times of the day
* wear a face covering on public transport
* plan your journey so you can walk or cycle into work for all or part of the way. If you have a car, you may decide to drive to work.
If you’ve spoken to your employer but still don’t feel safe at work, try contacting your ___LINK_REMOVED___, getting advice from ___LINK_REMOVED___, or contacting ___LINK_REMOVED___.  
 
## Seeing friends and family
If you’re worried about catching COVID-19, you may have some concerns about mixing with others.
While there will still be risks, there are some simple steps you can take to stay safe when meeting friends and family:  
 
* meet outside where possible
* let fresh air in by opening doors and windows if you’re meeting people inside where possible
* avoid crowded or enclosed places if you can/where possible
* avoid meeting others if any of you have COVID-19 symptoms.
The NHS also has some ___LINK_REMOVED___.  
 
## Care for your lung condition
It’s important to make sure you’re getting the care you need for your ___LINK_REMOVED___. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in some changes in care. For example, you may have had hospital or GP appointments over the phone or by video instead of in person. 
### Annual reviews
It’s important that you’re still having annual reviews, even if your lung condition is well-controlled. A regular annual review helps make sure your condition is managed as well as possible and lowers your risk of symptoms. If your annual review is due, try to book one as soon as possible. 
### Pulmonary rehabilitation
___LINK_REMOVED___ can help you to manage symptoms such as breathlessness. Ask your GP if PR courses are available in your area.
___LINK_REMOVED___ to help you keep exercising.
