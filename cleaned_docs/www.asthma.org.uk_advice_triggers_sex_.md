## Why does sex trigger asthma symptoms?
The good news is, if you’re managing your asthma well, you can feel more confident about having sex without asthma symptoms getting in the way.
Sex is like exercise - it gets our heartbeat going and we breathe more rapidly. And like exercise, if sex triggers your asthma symptoms – breathlessness, coughing, wheezing, tight chest - it probably means your asthma isn’t as well controlled as it could be.
### Watch out for other sex triggers too
* Heightened emotions like excitement
* Scented products like perfume, aftershave, scented candles, or oils
* Indoor triggers like dust, pets, wood burning stoves, or cigarette smoke
* Latex allergy - latex is used in most condoms and can trigger asthma symptoms if you have a known allergy to it
* Some sexual positions might make it harder for you to breathe.
## What to do if you get asthma symptoms during sex
Don’t be tempted to pretend nothing’s wrong and carry on. As soon as you get asthma symptoms stop what you’re doing and take your ___LINK_REMOVED___. The last thing you want is for symptoms to build up into an ___LINK_REMOVED___.
1. Tell your partner you need to stop for a moment.
2. Use your reliever inhaler.
3. Rest until you feel better.
4. Once your symptoms have stopped, carry on if you both still want to.
5. Switch positions. You might find it more comfortable to try positions where your chest isn’t weighed down. For example, both of you could lay on your sides, either facing each other or with one partner behind.
## 
 Keep your reliever close by
If you feel your asthma symptoms coming on during sex, use your reliever inhaler straight away. Make sure it's somewhere you can find it easily if you need to.
## What to do if you have an asthma attack during sex
An asthma attack during sex is like any other asthma attack. Sit up, try to stay calm, and ___LINK_REMOVED___.

## How to stop sex triggering asthma symptoms
The best way to stop sex from triggering your asthma symptoms is to make sure you’re managing your asthma well all the time.
This means:
* Taking your ___LINK_REMOVED___ every day as prescribed, even when you feel well.
* Using an up-to-date ___LINK_REMOVED___.
* Being aware of your ___LINK_REMOVED___ and doing your best to avoid them.
* Going for an ___LINK_REMOVED___ at least once a year.
* Booking to see your GP if you’re using your blue reliever inhaler three or more times a week, or your symptoms are stopping you from getting on with life, whether that’s work, family, or sex.
## Talking to a partner about asthma and sex
People with asthma tell us it can feel embarrassing to talk about how their asthma might affect intimacy and sex, especially with a new partner.
But it’s worth taking the time to talk about your asthma openly - much better that your partner knows about your asthma beforehand, rather than trying to explain your symptoms at the time.
Perhaps say:
“So, my asthma can sometimes be triggered by sex. I can manage it, I just wanted to let you know.”
“I’m going to leave my inhaler by the bed in case I need it.”
“Can we try this position instead? It means I can breathe more easily.’
## Talking to your GP about sex and asthma
Don’t put off talking to your GP or asthma nurse about sex. The sooner you get support to manage your asthma better, the sooner you can start enjoying sex again without worrying.
