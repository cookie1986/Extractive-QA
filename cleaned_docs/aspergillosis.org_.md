# What is Aspergillosis?
Aspergillosis is a group of conditions caused by Aspergillus, a species of mould that is found in lots of places all over the world.
**Most of these moulds are harmless**. However, some can cause a variety of diseases ranging from allergic reactions to life-threatening conditions, or both.
## **Aspergillosis rarely develops in healthy individuals**
 Most people breathe in theses spores every day without any issues.
### **Transmission**
You cannot catch aspergillosis from another person or from animals.
**There are 3 forms of Aspergillosis:**

# **Health Notice**
The Aspergillosis Website can be a very useful resource, but of course it cannot replace the vitally important relationship each patient has with their doctor. Nothing mentioned in this website should be taken as medical advice.
# **Support us**
FIT funding enables the National Aspergillosis Centre to host large Facebook groups, such as the National Aspergillosis Centre Support (UK) group and also groups that support their research into Chronic Pulmonary Aspergillosis (CPA) and Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA). This patient participation and involvement is vital for NAC research.
