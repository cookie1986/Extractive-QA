## How do steroids treat asthma?
The steroids used to treat asthma are known as corticosteroids. These are not the same as the steroids that some bodybuilders use, which are called anabolic steroids.  
Corticosteroids for asthma copy the steroids that the body produces naturally to help reduce injury or inflammation.
The steroids in asthma medicines lower your risk of having an asthma attack. They do this by treating inflammation in your airways (this is when your airways are swollen and narrow).  
* Your steroid preventer inhaler usually contains a low dose of steroid medicine. You need to take it every day as prescribed.
* You may also need steroid tablets if you have an asthma attack or your asthma is difficult to control.
## 
 Your reliever inhaler does not contain steroids
Your ___LINK_REMOVED___ (usually blue) opens up your airways when you’re having symptoms or an asthma attack. It does not contain steroids, so it cannot reduce inflammation in your airways.  
To prevent inflammation in your airways you need to use your steroid ___LINK_REMOVED___ every day, as prescribed. 
## Steroid preventer inhalers
If you take your preventer inhaler every day, as prescribed, you should notice fewer symptoms.  
This is because the steroids in your preventer inhaler work in the background to prevent inflammation from building up in your airways.  
If you take your steroid preventer inhaler every day as prescribed, your airways will be less inflamed, and you’ll be less likely to react to your asthma triggers and have symptoms or an asthma attack.
It’s important to take your steroid preventer inhaler every day, even if you feel well.

## Steroid tablets
You may be prescribed steroid tablets if you’re struggling to control your symptoms or if you’ve had an asthma attack.  
Steroid tablets treat inflammation in your airways. They stop symptoms from getting worse and lower your risk of having another asthma attack.
Your GP will work out how much you need to take, and for how long, depending on your symptoms and how you’re recovering.
You may just need a short course of steroids. Or you may need a longer course of steroids if your asthma is ___LINK_REMOVED___ or ___LINK_REMOVED___.  
### Short courses of steroid tablets
You may need a short course of steroid tablets to help you recover from an asthma attack. This is most likely to be a steroid medicine called ___LINK_REMOVED___.  
A course of steroid tablets can help you recover and lower your risk of another asthma attack. Because you’re only taking them for a short time, they’re unlikely to cause harmful side effects.  
If you need two or more short courses of steroid tablets in a year, or your symptoms come back once you’ve finished the course, you should ask your GP for a referral to a ___LINK_REMOVED___.  
### Long-term steroid tablets
If your symptoms are not well controlled, even while taking other treatments, your doctor may prescribe a longer course of steroid tablets.

> If you’re taking a long course of steroid tablets, ask your doctor or specialist for a referral to a specialist. This is so specialists can work out if treatments called biologics are suitable for you. You’ll need to keep taking the steroids while you’re waiting to be considered for biologics. Some people may need to continue taking them if they are not eligible for the biologic treatments available.

## Risks and side effects
Steroids can be lifesaving, but they can have side effects. You’re more likely to get side effects if:  
* you’re taking higher doses over a long period of time or
* you need a lot of short courses of steroid tablets because of asthma attacks.
### Side effects from your steroid preventer inhaler
Your steroid preventer inhaler is unlikely to cause side effects, especially if you’re using your inhaler correctly.
However, some people get side effects like a sore throat, a hoarse voice, or ___LINK_REMOVED___.
You can lower your risk of side effects by:
* using your inhaler ___LINK_REMOVED___
* gargling and rinsing your mouth out
* getting your ___LINK_REMOVED___ right.
Your doctor or asthma nurse will always aim to prescribe the lowest steroid dose in your preventer inhaler – enough for you to get good control over your symptoms, but as low as possible to reduce your risk of side effects.
And because the steroid medicine in your preventer inhaler is breathed in(inhaled), it goes straight down into your airways. This means very little is absorbed into the rest of the body.
But if you’re taking high doses for a long time, you may be at risk of some of the same side effects as steroid tablets.

### Side effects from steroid tablets
You’re less likely to get side effects from a short course of steroid tablets (less than three weeks).
Side effects are more likely if you take steroid tablets for three weeks or more or if you need four or more short courses a year.
People taking steroid tablets have reported side effects including:
* upset stomach
* ___LINK_REMOVED___
* wanting to eat more – and putting on weight
* finding it hard to sleep
* feeling anxious or having mood swings
These kinds of side effects usually stop once the course of tablets has finished.
But if you need to keep taking steroids you may be at risk of more long-term problems, including:
* steroid-induced ___LINK_REMOVED___
* thinning of the bones or ___LINK_REMOVED___
* ___LINK_REMOVED___
If you’re worried about any side effects, ask your GP or asthma nurse for advice as soon as possible. For example, if you have an upset stomach after taking steroids, your GP may suggest taking the tablet with meals or after food.

##  Common concerns about taking steroids
### Am I more likely to catch colds and viruses if I’m on steroids?
Taking high doses of steroid tablets can make your immune system weaker, so you may catch colds and viruses more often.
This is why it’s important to get your ___LINK_REMOVED___ and be up to date with your coronavirus vaccines.

### Am I more at risk from COVID-19 if I take steroids?
Most people with asthma who use a preventer inhaler are not at any increased risk from COVID-19.  
But if your asthma is poorly controlled and you need to take steroid tablets, you may be more at risk of severe disease from COVID-19.
Get more information about ___LINK_REMOVED___.  
### Will steroids affect my bone health?
The risk of ___LINK_REMOVED___ is much higher if you take high-dose steroids for more than three months.
At your annual ___LINK_REMOVED___, your GP or asthma nurse can talk to you about your risk and what you can do to reduce this risk.
### Will steroids make my face fat?
Some people who take steroid tablets or injected steroids long term, may find they put on weight and notice they develop a “moon-shaped” face. This is a symptom of a condition called Cushing’s syndrome, linked to taking high doses of steroids.
Find out more about the ___LINK_REMOVED___ from long-term steroids.
### Is it safe to take steroids if I have other conditions or take other medicines?
Talk to your GP about other conditions you have and medicines you take, like high blood pressure, stomach ulcer or diabetes.  
Some medicines react with steroid medicines, including ___LINK_REMOVED___.
### I’m worried about my child taking steroids
If you’re worried about your child taking steroid inhalers, or side effects from steroid tablets, speak to your GP or asthma nurse. You can also read our advice about the ___LINK_REMOVED___. 
## Stopping steroids safely
Never stop taking your steroid medicines before speaking to your GP or asthma nurse.  
* If you stop taking your steroid preventer inhaler, the inflammation in your airways may get worse and you’ll notice more symptoms and be at higher risk of an asthma attack.
* If you stop taking steroid tablets before you’ve finished the course, your airways may still be inflamed, and you may be at risk of another asthma attack.
* Stopping steroids suddenly can be dangerous, particularly if you’re on a high dose. In some cases, stopping steroid medicines suddenly causes an ‘adrenal crisis’. This is where levels of your body’s own stress hormone cortisol drops dramatically and can make you feel very unwell. It’s a life-threatening emergency.
“Most people on a short course of steroid tablets can safely stop at the end of their course, as long as they’ve recovered well,” says DrAndy Whittamore.  
“If you’re ___LINK_REMOVED___, or you’re taking steroids all the time, you may be advised to come off them slowly.” 
## Carry a steroid card
Some people who take medicines containing steroids may need a steroid emergency card. It depends on what total daily dose of steroid medicine you’re taking and for how long.
For example, your doctor may ask you to carry a steroid card:
* if you need oral steroids (for example, prednisolone) for longer than four weeks
* if you’ve needed several short courses of oral steroids in a year
* if your preventer inhaler contains high doses of steroid medicine. You need to check with your GP or asthma nurse or pharmacist if you’re not sure
* you’re taking other types of steroid medicine - for example, steroid nasal drops or steroid creams, alongside your steroid inhaler, which could add up to a high overall dose.
You can get a steroid card from your GP. A steroid emergency card lets healthcare professionals and emergency doctors know you take steroids. It is useful in emergency situations - for example, if you’re in an accident or become seriously ill.  
This is because when you’re on high doses of steroids your body may stop producing enough of its own natural steroids to help illness or injury. This means that doctors will need to give you extra corticosteroids.
At your next appointment, ask your doctor or asthma nurse what your total daily dose of steroid medicine is, from your preventer medicine and any other steroid medicines you’re taking. They can let you know if you should be carrying a steroid card.
If you do need a steroid card, make sure you always carry it with you. If you lose it, you can get a replacement from your pharmacy or GP.
