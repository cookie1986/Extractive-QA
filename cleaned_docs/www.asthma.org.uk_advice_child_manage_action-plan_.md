## What is an asthma action plan?
An asthma action plan has all the information you need in one place so you can look after your child’s asthma well.
Your child’s asthma action plan:
* reminds you what to do every day to keep your child well
* shows you what symptoms to look out for and what to do if your child’s asthma gets worse
* tells you what to do if your child has an asthma attack
You fill in the plan with your child’s GP or asthma nurse, so you can make sure it’s personal to your child and their asthma.
Then take it along to all their asthma appointments so the GP or asthma nurse can make sure it’s up to date. 
## How can an asthma action plan help my child?
Using an action plan is one of the best things you can do to keep your child safe and well with their asthma.
Your child’s asthma action plan
* makes it easier to look after your child’s asthma every day so they’re less likely to need hospital treatment for an asthma attack
* shows what to do if your child has symptoms. And tells you the emergency action you need to take ___LINK_REMOVED___
* helps you show others how to look after your child’s asthma, like ___LINK_REMOVED___
* keeps things on track when routines change, for example when your child’s on school holidays

## How do I get an asthma action plan for my child?
If your child doesn’t have an asthma action plan yet, it only takes three easy steps to get started:
1. ___LINK_REMOVED___ If your child is over 12 they can choose to download the ___LINK_REMOVED___ instead. If you can, print out a copy ready to take to your GP.
2. Book an asthma appointment with your child’s GP or asthma nurse
3. At the appointment talk through the plan with your child’s GP or asthma nurse and fill it in together. Ask them to save a copy onto your notes and send you it to you on email, SMS or WhatsApp.
## How to get the best from your child’s action plan
### Get your child involved in their own action plan from the start
Let your child help fill it in with the GP and encourage them to ask questions.
Even if your child is very young you can tell them that the plan is where you and the doctor write down all the things that will help them stay well with their asthma.
If your child is old enough let them have a copy of their action plan, or keep a copy on their phone.
### Keep your child’s action plan where you can see it
Stick it on the fridge, or pin it to a noticeboard.
Ask your child's GP or asthma nurse for a digital copy so you can save it on your phone. That way it’s always easy to find when you need it.
### Share your child’s action plan with others
Whether it’s a paper or a digital copy, share your child’s action plan with friends, family, teachers and carers.
It can give you peace of mind that ___LINK_REMOVED___ has the information they need to keep your child well.
### Use your child’s asthma action plan alongside our other resources for children
As well as your child’s asthma action plan, you can use our ___LINK_REMOVED___ to help you and your child track their asthma symptoms.
