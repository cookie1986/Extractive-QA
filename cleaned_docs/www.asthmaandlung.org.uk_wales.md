* **OSA**: estimated to be at least 13% of adult men and 6% of adult women living with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea.
* **Air pollution**: Around 2,000 people in Wales die early every year due to dirty air
### Our work
* We are campaigning for lung health to be treated as a national priority and fight for a Wales where everyone can breathe clean air with healthy lungs.
* We raise the profile of lung conditions in the Senedd and lead the ___LINK_REMOVED___. This provides a platform for MSs from all political parties to discuss issues relating to asthma and to ensure government policies work to improve care and services for people with asthma.
* We worked with the Welsh Government to develop the ___LINK_REMOVED___ and are campaigning for a ___LINK_REMOVED___ colleagues. All parties supported a Clean Air Act in their manifestos and yet the Welsh Government delays it.
* We work with ASH Wales and other partners to campaign for more investment in smoking cessation and further restrictions to keep young people safe from tobacco. We successfully campaigned for the new Tobacco Control strategy to aim for less than 5% of people smoking by 2030.
* We have championed a nationwide programme for lung screening to be delivered across Wales.
* We worked with Welsh Government to develop and implement the ___LINK_REMOVED___ and are now shaping the next plan.
* We are working with the physiotherapy community to champion the right to rehabilitation so that everyone with lung conditions has the right to some form of pulmonary rehabilitation when they need it.
