## What is air pollution?
An air pollutant is anything in the air that could harm peopleâ€™s health. There are many types, but our two main focuses are Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5) as they are at very high levels in the UK and are extremely harmful for health. ___LINK_REMOVED___.
