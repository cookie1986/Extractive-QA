# Could you have severe asthma?
Could you benefit from newer and better treatments for severe asthma?
Thousands of people are living with asthma symptoms or treatment side effects they don't need to have. We want to help you get the care you need and find a balance that works. With the right help and the right medicines, you could feel better.
Take 5 minutes to find out if you:
* Could get an improvement in your asthma symptoms
* Should talk to your GP about getting referred to a severe asthma specialist
* Could benefit from talking to your specialist team about biologic medicines for asthma
**We can’t tell you if you have severe asthma or not.** Getting a severe asthma diagnosis takes time and a range of medical tests. We also can’t tell you what medicines are right for you. These are things your doctors will work out with you.
**We can help you take the next step to making sure your asthma is as well managed as it can be.** If you choose to sign up to our emails, we can also support you along the way.
For people with asthma aged 18 and up. Anonymous data from these questions may be used for research, campaigns, and product and service development.
