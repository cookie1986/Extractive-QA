## Before you book
* See your GP or healthcare professional for any necessary health checks and for a review your treatment plan or asthma action plan.
* Get a copy of your prescription and a letter from your GP with details of your medicines and the name of your condition or conditions.
* Make sure your destination is suitable and accessible for you.
* Look into travel insurance costs. Remember to tell your travel insurer about all your medical conditions.
* Check if your planned mode of transport is accessible.
## If you need oxygen
* Ask your supplier how you can get it while you’re away.
* If you plan to fly, check the ___LINK_REMOVED___. Make sure you’ve filled out a medical clearance form with your doctor.
## Before you travel
* Plan your route from door to door. Think about how far you will have to travel, how many stops you might have to make and what access is like at your destination. Give yourself a lot of time!
* Make sure you have enough medicine for your whole trip, including extra to cover any delays.
* Make sure you have your self-management plan or ___LINK_REMOVED___.
* Arrange emergency antibiotics or steroids if you might need them. Ask your doctor or healthcare professional if you’re not sure.
* Make a list of the medicines you take in case you need more during your holiday or need to show a doctor if you become ill.
* Send your travel provider any fitness to travel documents they have asked for.
* Arrange any travel assistance you might need, such as help getting through the airport or boarding a train.
* Make sure your travel companions know about your condition and what to do if you have symptoms.
## During your holiday
* When you arrive, find the nearest hospital or clinic, and check its opening times.
* Find out how to get more of your medicines if they get lost or damaged. You could ask your travel provider or hotel reception. Look online for the nearest pharmacy or healthcare centre so you know where they are before you go.
* Take copies of your list of medicines, medical letters, and insurance policy with you.
* Take a list of emergency contact numbers, including your GP’s number, with you.
* If you start to feel unwell, seek medical advice quickly. If you’re abroad, check any new medicine you’re given is allowed back into the UK.
