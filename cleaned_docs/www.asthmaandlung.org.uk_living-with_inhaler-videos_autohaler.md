Hello. I'm Omar Usmani. I'm a consultant respiratory physician. I'm going to show you how to use an autohaler. This is a breath-actuated inhaler. Getting your inhaler technique right is very important because it helps you manage symptoms better. It may take a few tries to feel comfortable using your inhaler, but it does get easier with practice To get your inhaler ready to use for the first time, or if you haven't used it for two weeks or more, first, take off the cover by pulling down the lip at the back Hold the inhaler upright and point the mouthpiece away from you. Flip the red lever on the top up until it clicks into place. Release a puff of medicine by pushing the plastic slide underneath the inhaler in the same direction as the arrow. Lower the red lever and then push it up again. Release a second puff of medicine using the plastic slide. Lower the red lever. Your inhaler is now ready to use. First, take off the cover by pulling down the lip at the back. Check that there is nothing inside the inhaler mouthpiece. Hold the inhaler upright, making sure you're not covering the air vents at the bottom. Shake the inhaler well. Flip the red lever on the top up until it clicks into place. Sit or stand up straight and slightly tilt your chin up as it helps the medicine reach your lungs. The next steps all happen smoothly in one action. Breathe out gently and slowly, away from the inhaler until your lungs feel empty and you feel ready to breathe in. Put your lips around the mouthpiece of the inhaler to make a tight seal. Breathe in slowly and steadily continuing to breathe in when you hear a click and feel a puff of medicine in your mouth. Take the inhaler out of your mouth and hold your breath for up to 10 seconds or for as long as you comfortably can. Then breathe out gently away from your inhaler. Lower the red lever on the top of the inhaler. If you've been prescribed a second puff, wait 30 seconds to a minute and shake the inhaler again. Then repeat the steps. When you have finished, put the cover back on and make sure the red lever is down. If you have used an inhaler that contains steroids, rinse your mouth with water and spit it out to reduce the chance of side effects. For more tips on using the inhaler, why not watch our other videos.
