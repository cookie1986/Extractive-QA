Most people infected with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people are at higher risk of serious illness
## What are the symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19)?
Symptoms of COVID-19 in adults can be:  
* a high temperature or shivering (chills) – you might feel hot to touch
* a new continuous cough
* a loss or change in your sense of smell or taste
* shortness of breath
* feeling tired or exhausted
* muscle and joint aches
* a headache
* a sore throat
* a blocked or runny nose

The symptoms of COVID-19 may be like a cold or flu. They might also be like the symptoms of your lung condition, or symptoms you get when your lung condition flares up.

### COVID-19 testing
COVID-19 tests are no longer free for most people.
You can get free COVID-19 rapid lateral flow tests if your lung condition means you’re eligible for COVID-19 treatments [link to treatments page]. If you’re eligible, you can order tests for free through ___LINK_REMOVED___ or by calling 119.
If you work in healthcare or social care, you may also be entitled to free tests. Check the advice for ___LINK_REMOVED___, ___LINK_REMOVED___, ___LINK_REMOVED___ or ___LINK_REMOVED___.
If you are not eligible for free rapid lateral flow tests, you can buy them from some pharmacies and retailers, both in store and online.   
 
## Am I more at risk because I have a lung condition?
If you have a long-term lung condition, you’re at a higher risk of becoming very ill with coronavirus.  This includes people with:
* chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
* bronchiectasis
* cystic fibrosis
* interstitial lung disease, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), hypersensitivity pneumonitis or pneumoconiosis
* bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)
* lung cancer
* mesothelioma
* pulmonary hypertension
* sarcoidosis
* a long-term lung infection such as tuberculosis or aspergillosis
* a recent lung transplant
* other long-term health issues that affect the lungs, such as an autoimmune condition or connective tissue disease.
### Am I more at risk if I have asthma?
Most people with well-controlled asthma are not at any higher risk from coronavirus than the general population.  
Some people with asthma might be more at risk if they:
* have non-allergic asthma
* have ___LINK_REMOVED___ or poorly controlled asthma
* are immunosuppressed due to high doses of steroids
## 
### 
 Poorly controlled asthma means:
* taking two or more courses of oral corticosteroids in the last 24 months, or
* taking steroid tablets every day for asthma, or
* you’ve had one or more hospital admission for asthma in the last 24 months.
If you’re having asthma symptoms or have to use your reliever inhaler three or more times a week, it’s a sign your asthma is not as well controlled as it could be.  Make an appointment to see your GP or asthma nurse.   
 
___LINK_REMOVED___ for severe asthma does not increase your risk of getting infected with COVID-19 or becoming very ill with it. 
### Am I more at risk if I take immunosuppressive medicine?
Some medicines can make your immune system weaker. If you’re taking any of these medicines, you could be at higher risk from COVID-19:  
* prednisolone
* methotrexate
* mycophenolate mofetil
* mercaptopurine
* oral tacrolimus
* ciclosporin
* azathioprine.
If you’re not sure whether the medicines you’re taking mean you’re more at risk, check with your doctor or healthcare professional.  
 
### Other risk factors
You may also be at risk of getting very ill from COVID-19 if you:
* are age 60 or older – the older you are, the more your risk increases
* are pregnant – the ___LINK_REMOVED___
* have another health condition. The NHS has ___LINK_REMOVED___ about which health conditions put you at increased risk of coronavirus.
* are not vaccinated against COVID-19.
## Help if you’re feeling worried
It’s understandable to be feeling worried or anxious about coronavirus, especially if you live with a long-term lung condition. But if you’re struggling to cope, you can talk to your GP or healthcare professional for advice and support.
Here are some tips to help you look after your mental health: 
* Try to keep active. You could use the ___LINK_REMOVED___. Getting outside for some fresh air can improve your mood too.
* Keep in touch with your friends and family. In stressful times we cope better with support from those close to us.
* Ask for help if you need it. We have advice for ___LINK_REMOVED___.
