Hi I'm Caroline. I'm a respiratory nurse specialist. I'm going to show you how to use an Easi-Breathe inhaler. This is a breath-actuated inhaler meaning it automatically works as you take a breath in. Getting your inhaler technique right is very important because it helps you manage your symptoms better. It may take a few tries to feel comfortable using your inhaler, but it does get easier with practice. Before you use your inhaler for the first time or if it hasn't been used for five days or more you will need to test it. You do this by spraying two puffs of the medicine into the air. First, unscrew the top of your inhaler so you can see the metal canister inside. Fold down the cap and shake the inhaler well. Pointing the mouthpiece away from you, spray the aerosol into the air by pressing the canister with your finger or thumb. Spray a second puff, then put the top back on and close the cap. Now your inhaler is ready to use. First, hold the inhaler upright and shake the inhaler well. Then open the cap. Check there's nothing inside the mouthpiece. Make sure you're not covering the air holes at the top. Sit or stand up straight and slightly tilt your chin up as it helps the medicine reach your lungs. The next steps all happen smoothly in one action. Breathe out gently and slowly away from the inhaler until your lungs feel empty and you feel ready to breathe in. Put your lips around the mouthpiece of the inhaler to make a tight seal. Breathe in slowly and steadily. Continue to breathe in when you feel the inhaler puff in your mouth until you have taken a full deep breath in. Take the inhaler out of your mouth and hold your breath for up to ten seconds or for as long as you comfortably can, then breathe out gently away from the inhaler. If you've been prescribed a second puff, close the cap, wait one minute and shake the inhaler again. Then repeat the steps. When you've finished, close the cap. If you've used an inhaler that contains steroids, rinse your mouth with water and spit it out to reduce the chance of side effects. For more tips on using your inhaler, why not watch our other videos.
