Hi I'm Caroline. I'm a respiratory nurse. I'm going to show you how to use a Spiromax inhaler. This is a dry powder device or DPI. Getting your inhaler technique right is very important because it helps you manage symptoms better. It may take a few tries to feel comfortable using your inhaler but it does get easier with practice. To use your inhaler, first open the cap by pulling it down until you hear a click. Check there's nothing inside the mouthpiece. Check the dose counter to make sure the inhaler isn't empty. Hold the inhaler upright. Do not tip the inhaler upside down as the powder may fall out. Sit or stand up straight and slightly tilt your chin up as it helps the medicine reach your lungs. The next steps all happen smoothly in one action. Breathe out gently and slowly away from the inhaler, until your lungs feel empty and you feel ready to breathe in. Put your lips around the mouthpiece to make a tight seal taking care not to block the air vent. Then breathe in quickly and deeply until your lungs feel full. Take the inhaler out of your mouth and hold your breath for up to ten seconds or for as long as you comfortably can. Then breathe out gently away from your inhaler. If you've been prescribed a second puff, close the cap to reset the device and repeat the steps. When you've finished, close the cap. If you've used an inhaler that contains steroids, rinse your mouth with water and spit it out to reduce the chance of side effects. For more tips on using your inhaler, why not watch our other videos.
