## Why do recreational drugs trigger asthma?
You cannot be sure how you’ll react to drugs, even if you have taken them before.
Most recreational drugs are unregulated, so you will never know what’s really in them or how strong they are. Misusing prescription medicines can also be very dangerous.
Most recreational drugs can be addictive, and they can all cause a ___LINK_REMOVED___ that impact your physical and mental health.

 If your asthma's not well managed
you’re more at risk from asthma triggers. Find out what to do if your ___LINK_REMOVED___.
When your asthma is well managed, you should be symptom free, and won’t need to use your reliever inhaler often (if at all).
Abusing recreational drugs can also trigger your asthma symptoms, increasing your risk of having a potentially life-threatening asthma attack. Below we have listed some of the side effects of commonly used recreational drugs and explain how they might impact your asthma.
### Slow/shallow breathing
These recreational drugs can reduce how well we breathe:
* Ketamine
* PCP (angel dust)
* Benzos (like Valium and Xanax)
* Heroin
This can be dangerous, especially if you have also drunk alcohol.
### Emotional changes
Any ___LINK_REMOVED___ – good or bad – can impact your breathing and cause your asthma symptoms to worsen. Recreational drugs can seriously affect your emotions:
* All recreational drugs can impact ___LINK_REMOVED___, and most can make you feel anxious, depressed, or panicked.
* Cocaine and ecstasy (MDMA) may trigger feelings of euphoria and panic.
* LSD (acid) and other hallucinogenic drugs might cause you to feel excited, giggly, or worried.
* NOs (laughing gas) can cause you to feel euphoric, excited and laugh uncontrollably.
### Increased physical activity
Cocaine, ecstasy (MDMA), and speed can cause you to feel energetic, alert, and restless. Any increase in ___LINK_REMOVED___ may trigger your asthma if it isn’t well controlled.
### Worse asthma management
Drugs users tend to have worse asthma management because they are less likely to take their asthma preventer medicines every day as prescribed.
### Chest infections
Marijuana (weed) and heroin can increase your risk of getting ___LINK_REMOVED___, including pneumonia.
### Lung damage
Smoking marijuana (weed) and crack cocaine can cause long-term lung damage.
### Nasal irritation
Inhaling solvents, aerosols or any chemical with a strong smell can trigger asthma symptoms.
## Staying safe
The best way to look after your asthma is to avoid taking recreational drugs altogether. However, we know that this isn’t always the case, so it’s important that you know how to stay safe.
Taking your preventer medicines as prescribed every day is the best way to keep your asthma under control. This stops inflammation from building up in your airways and means that you’re less likely to react to your asthma triggers.
## 
 Five ways to stay safe:
1. Try not to use drugs by yourself. Being around people you trust means they can help you in an emergency.
2. Keep a photo of your ___LINK_REMOVED___ on your phone so you or a friend can quickly check what to do if you get asthma symptoms or have an asthma attack.
3. Avoid mixing drugs with alcohol, as this worsens their effects.
4. Always keep your reliever inhaler (usually blue) on you so that you can manage any symptoms quickly.
5. Take regular breaks if you’re dancing or on your feet all night.
Seek medical help straight away if you notice that your asthma symptoms are getting worse. It’s incredibly important that you tell a healthcare professional everything you have taken. Knowing this information will make sure they give you the best care possible.
