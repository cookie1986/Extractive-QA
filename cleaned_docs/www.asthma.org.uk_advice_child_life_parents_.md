## I feel overwhelmed by all the information about asthma
There is a lot of information to take in when you’re caring for a child with asthma. So it’s very normal to feel confused or overwhelmed.
Our health advice walks you through all of the stages of supporting your child, from ___LINK_REMOVED___ to ___LINK_REMOVED___. You can also use the search box if you have any specific worries, such as sleep issues.
You can always ask your child’s GP or asthma nurse if you’re unsure about something. Remember that no question is silly and that they’re there to help you.
## I’m scared about my child’s asthma
It’s normal to feel worried when your child has asthma. You might feel scared when they’re first diagnosed with asthma, if they’re having asthma symptoms, or if they’ve recently had an asthma attack.  
Following these easy steps can help you manage your child’s asthma and lower their risk of having an asthma attack:
* ___LINK_REMOVED___ If your child’s having an asthma attack, recognising the signs and acting quickly could save their life
* Work out your child’s ___LINK_REMOVED___
* Use your child’s ___LINK_REMOVED___ so that all the information you need to manage your child’s asthma is in one place
* Make sure your child knows ___LINK_REMOVED___
## People don’t understand my child’s asthma
Having a child with asthma can be challenging sometimes. If you feel like you’re not getting the support you need from your child’s teachers or healthcare professionals, you can:
* Make sure you know ___LINK_REMOVED___
* Help teachers understand what your child needs to ___LINK_REMOVED___
* Be prepared in case you have to ___LINK_REMOVED___
Share your child’s written asthma action plan with any other adults in your child’s life – like grandparents, sports coaches, and their friends’ parents or carers.
## I feel like it’s my fault that my child has asthma
We know that sometimes you might feel like it’s somehow your fault that your child has asthma, but there is no need to feel guilty. Remember that asthma is a common condition and ___LINK_REMOVED___
## I feel like I’m dealing with this all on my own
Whatever you’re feeling, whether you’re having a bad day or just need a bit of guidance, remember that you are not alone. There is help and support out there for you.
You can chat with one of our expert asthma nurses (Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm) by calling 0300 222 5800 or sending a ___LINK_REMOVED___ message to 07378 606 728. Or, you can connect with other parents and carers in the same situation as you on our ___LINK_REMOVED___
If you’d rather speak to somebody face-to-face, you could try asking friends and relatives if they know any other parents and carers whose children have asthma.
It might help to make a list of everyone who can offer practical help in your day-to-day life. For example, could someone help look after your other children when you take your child to an asthma review? It’s also a good idea to think about who can support you emotionally. Is there anybody you can text, call or meet up with when you’re feeling worried or down?
## I’m feeling stressed
Forgetting to look after yourself is easy when life gets busy or demanding, especially if you’re worried about your child’s asthma too. But when you’re stressed, it can make it harder to take care of anyone else. It’s important to:
* ___LINK_REMOVED___ Read our tips about how to keep days out, holidays, and relationships on track.
* Try out these ___LINK_REMOVED___
* Take a break. It’s important to make time for yourself, whether that’s taking up a new hobby, enjoying time with friends, or having a relaxing bath.
* Talk to your employer. You’re entitled to a reasonable amount of ___LINK_REMOVED___
