# Our latest work
Lung conditions are the third biggest killer in the UK, yet too little is being done to prevent, treat and cure them. We’re fighting to change this.
### Levelling up lung health
The government was elected in 2019 on a mission to “unite and level up” the country. This was a welcome promise to tackle the deep-rooted place-based inequalities that can be found across the UK in all areas of public life, including educational attainment, pay, labour market access, transport accessibility and health outcomes. After much disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic, the government has finally set out what it means by “levelling up” in its white paper, Levelling Up the UK, published in February 2022.
In response to this, Asthma + Lung UK have set out five stress tests that we will be holding the government to account on over the next eight years, as it seeks to level up the UK by 2030, to make sure it overcomes the inequalities at the centre of poor lung health.

### Our asthma reports

**Severe asthma**
Severe asthma affects a small number of people with asthma but its impact can be devastating. Our research tackles the scale of the problem, access to life-changing treatments, and the real exerience of life with severe and difficult asthma.

**Basic care – annual asthma surveys**
Every year we conduct a major survey of people with asthma, examining the standards of care they receive, and their real-life exerience of living with the condition. Previous issues of the report can also be accessed from the latest survey page.

**Health inequalities**
Factors such as where you live, your age and your economic circumstances can affect your chances of developing asthma – and the care you receive. We explore the links between deprivation and asthma, and how to reduce the unfair burden.

**Digital asthma and data sharing**
Technology has the potential to develop new ways to tackle persistent asthma care challenges. We’re exploring how data, digital and connected devices can better be used to re-imagine care at all levels – and ensuring that the patient voice is heard in policy developments.

### Our lung condition reports
___LINK_REMOVED___ uses insight gathered from our beneficiaries to analyse whether air pollution information is getting to people who need it most. The report sets out how government should work with others to ensure the information it provides helps people to both protect themselves and reduce levels air pollution across the country. It also sets out what needs to be done to improve the alerts that are sent out when pollution levels are high in order to protect everyone’s lungs.
___LINK_REMOVED___ (PDF 4.9mb) demonstrates the huge impact of smoking on life expectancy and that the government’s levelling up health agenda can only be achieved by a renewed effort to cut smoking rates. It provides effective, evidenced based policies for doing this.
___LINK_REMOVED___ **(2021)**
Insights from those living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) around the UK.
___LINK_REMOVED___ highlights the unfair burden which air pollution places on deprived communities across the UK, with new analysis showing the number of babies born into toxic air. It discusses why cleaning up our air should be central to the Government’s levelling up agenda and a key part of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050.
___LINK_REMOVED___ shows that not enough GPs are equipped to have effective conversations about smoking with patients.
___LINK_REMOVED___ outlines the enormous impact COVID-19 has had on the care received by people with lung disease across the UK.
___LINK_REMOVED___ reveals that up to 1,040 deaths per year in Liverpool can be directly linked to exposure to air pollution.
___LINK_REMOVED___ reveals that millions of patients and healthcare practitioners across the UK are exposed to unsafe levels of pollution.
___LINK_REMOVED___ highlights how every year fewer patients are being given treatments to help them quit smoking.
___LINK_REMOVED___ examines the overall extent and impact of lung disease across the UK.
___LINK_REMOVED___ reveals the financial cost of lung disease to the NHS, patients and the economy.
