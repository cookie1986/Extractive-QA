### Our work
* We are campaigning against toxic air in Glasgow, working with local and community groups to fight for clean air. You can read about the current situation in the city and the change that is needed ___LINK_REMOVED___.
* We are campaigning for lung health to be treated as a national priority and fight for a Scotland where everyone can breathe clean air with healthy lungs.
* We raise the profile of lung conditions in the Scottish Parliament and lead the ___LINK_REMOVED___. This provides a platform for MSPs from all political parties to discuss issues relating to asthma and to ensure government policies work to improve care and services for people with asthma.
* We campaign for action to reduce air pollution including the roll out of ___LINK_REMOVED___ across Scotland and tackling domestic burning in urban areas.
* We work with ASH Scotland and other partners to campaign greater investment in targeted smoking cessation programmes and mass media campaigns to achieve the 2034 target of less than 5% of people smoking.
* We have championed a nationwide programme for lung screening to be delivered across Scotland.
* We campaigned for a ___LINK_REMOVED___ and are working with the Scottish Government and health care professionals to implement it.
* We are working with the physiotherapy community to champion the right to rehabilitation so that everyone with lung conditions has the right to some form of pulmonary rehabilitation when they need it.
