## What’s the link between lung conditions and mental health?
It’s quite common for people with long-term conditions, including lung conditions, to have ___LINK_REMOVED___ and ___LINK_REMOVED___. For many people, living with a lung condition affects their quality of life.
You can have physical symptoms, like getting out of breath and feeling tired. But living with a long-term health condition can also affect your mental health and your ability to cope with daily life. 
Living with a lung condition can have mental and emotional challenges, including: 
* living in fear of a flare-up or an asthma attack or of not being able to breathe
* feeling frustrated when employers, family, or friends don’t understand your condition, or when you feel you’re not always supported or listened to by healthcare professionals
* worrying about how your lung condition is affecting family, partners, friends, and carers, and feeling unhappy about needing regular treatment and support from others
* feeling depressed because it’s hard to do things due to your symptoms
* feeling anxious about finances and work, or about the future, and what will happen if your lung condition gets worse
* dealing with loneliness, because your symptoms mean you miss out on socialising, or because other people don’t understand what you’re going through
* feeling stressed and anxious after spending time in hospital, particularly if time in intensive care has resulted in ___LINK_REMOVED___.
A lack of sleep can affect how you feel too. Often people with lung conditions find sleeping difficult, because of symptoms keeping them awake at night. This could be because of other related conditions like obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). 
Your mood can also be affected by side effects from your medicines. These side effects can include mood swings.
