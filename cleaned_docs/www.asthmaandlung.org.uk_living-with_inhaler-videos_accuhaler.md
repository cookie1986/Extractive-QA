 Transcript
Hi I'm Sonia, a respiratory physiotherapist. I'm going to show you how to use an Accuhaler. This is a dry powdered device or a DPI. Getting your inhaler technique right is very important because it helps you manage your symptoms better. It may take a few tries to feel comfortable using your inhaler, but it does get easier with practice. To use your inhaler, first slide open the cover. Check there's nothing inside the mouthpiece and check the dose counter to make sure there are enough puffs left. Hold the inhaler horizontally, but don't tip it upside down as the powder may fall out. Load the device by pushing back the lever with your thumb until it clicks. Sit or stand up straight and slightly tilt your chin up as this helps the medicine reach your lungs. The next steps all happen in one smooth action. Breathe out gently and slowly away from the inhaler, until your lungs feel empty and you feel ready to breathe in. Put your lips around the mouthpiece to make a tight seal. Breathe in quickly and deeply until your lungs feel full. Take the inhaler out of your mouth and hold your breath for up to ten seconds or for as long as you comfortably can. Then breathe out gently away from your inhaler. If you've been prescribed a second puff, slide the cover closed to reset the inhaler and repeat the steps. When you've finished, close the cover. If you've used an inhaler that contains steroids, rinse your mouth with water and spit it out to reduce any chance of side effects. For more tips on using your inhaler, why not watch our other videos.
