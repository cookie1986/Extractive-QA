 Transcript
Hi. I'm Caroline. I'm a respiratory nurse. I'm going to show you how to use a Genuair inhaler. This is a dry powder device or DPI. Getting your inhaler technique right is very important because it helps you manage symptoms better. It may take a few tries to feel comfortable using your inhaler, but it does get easier with practice. To use your inhaler, squeeze the arrows on each side of the cap and take it off. Check there's nothing inside the mouthpiece. Check the dose counter to make sure the inhaler isn't empty. The control window should be red, which shows you the inhaler isn't ready to use yet. Hold the inhaler horizontally with the coloured button on top, but don't tip it upside down as the powder may fall out. Then press the button all the way down and release it. If the button does not press, this means the device is empty. Check that the control window has changed to green. This means the dose is ready. Sit or stand up straight and slightly tilt your chin up as it helps the medicine reach your lungs. The next steps all happen smoothly in one action. Breathe out slowly and gently, away from the inhaler until your lungs feel empty and you feel ready to breathe in. Put your lips around the mouthpiece to make a tight seal, then, breathe in quickly and deeply. You should hear a click. Keep breathing in so you get all the medicine. Take the inhaler out of your mouth and hold your breath for up to 10 seconds or for as long as you comfortably can. Then breathe out gently away from your inhaler. Check that the control window has changed back to red. This means the dose has been taken. If the control window is still green, make sure you have released the coloured button and repeat the steps, starting with breathing out. When you've finished, replace the cap. For more tips on using your inhaler, why not watch our other videos.
