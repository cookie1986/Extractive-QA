One person in five in the UK will have a lung condition in their lifetime. As the nation’s lung charity, Asthma + Lung UK is here for every one of them. Our support helps people who struggle to breathe, manage their lung condition and live well. Our world-leading research finds new ways to prevent, treat and cure lung disease. And our campaigns help make vital, lasting change.
Asthma + Lung UK was formed from the merger of Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation. This is an exciting time to join the team as we work to change the face of respiratory care in the UK.
We’re looking for individuals who are passionate about our cause, are keen to grow and develop, and strive for improvement and innovation. So, if you’re looking for the next step in your career, we’d love to hear from you.
We only accept applications directly from candidates or on occasions via an appointed recruitment agency.
