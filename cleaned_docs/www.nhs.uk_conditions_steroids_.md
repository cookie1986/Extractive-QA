# Steroids
**Steroids, also called corticosteroids, are anti-inflammatory medicines used to treat a range of conditions.**
They're different from ___LINK_REMOVED___, which are often used illegally by some people to increase their muscle mass.

Steroids come in many different forms.
The main types are:
* ___LINK_REMOVED___ – such as ___LINK_REMOVED___
* ___LINK_REMOVED___ – such as ___LINK_REMOVED___ and ___LINK_REMOVED___
* ___LINK_REMOVED___ – such as ___LINK_REMOVED___ and ___LINK_REMOVED___
* ___LINK_REMOVED___ (given into joints, muscles or blood vessels) – such as methylprednisolone

Most steroids are only available on prescription, but a few (such as some creams or nasal sprays) can be bought from pharmacies and shops.
## Side effects of steroids
Steroids do not tend to cause significant side effects if they're taken for a short time or at a low dose.
But sometimes they can cause unpleasant side effects, such as an increased appetite, mood changes and ___LINK_REMOVED___. This is most common with steroid tablets.
The side effects will usually pass once you finish the treatment, but do not stop taking your medicine without speaking to your doctor. Stopping a prescribed course of medicine can cause further unpleasant side effects (withdrawal symptoms).

## How steroids work
Steroids are a man-made version of hormones normally produced by the adrenal glands which are 2 small glands found above the kidneys.
When taken in doses higher than the amount your body normally produces, steroids reduce redness and swelling (inflammation). This can help with inflammatory conditions such as asthma and eczema.
Steroids also reduce the activity of the immune system, which is the body's natural defence against illness and infection.
This can help treat autoimmune conditions, such as ___LINK_REMOVED___ or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body.
