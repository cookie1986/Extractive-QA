# High temperature (fever) in children
**A high temperature is very common in young children. The temperature usually returns to normal within 3 or 4 days.**
## What is a high temperature?
Information: 
A normal temperature in babies and children is about 36.4C, but this can vary slightly from child to child.
A high temperature is 38C or more.
A high temperature is the body's natural response to fighting infections like coughs and colds.
Many things can cause a high temperature in children, from common childhood illnesses like chickenpox and tonsillitis, to vaccinations.
## Checking a high temperature
Your child might:
* feel hotter than usual when you touch their back or chest
* feel sweaty
* look or feel unwell
Use a digital thermometer, which you can buy from pharmacies and supermarkets, to take your child's temperature.
 How to take your child's temperature
 
1. Place the thermometer inside the top of the armpit.
2. Gently close the arm over the thermometer and keep it pressed to the side of the body.
3. Leave the thermometer in place for as long as it says in the instruction leaflet. Some digital thermometers beep when they're ready.
4. Remove the thermometer. The display will show your child's temperature.
If your child's just had a bath or been wrapped in a blanket, their temperature may be higher for a short time. Wait a few minutes then try again.
## What to do if your child has a high temperature
You can usually look after your child or baby at home. The temperature should go down over 3 or 4 days.
