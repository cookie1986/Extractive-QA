## World Asthma Day 2nd May
To celebrate World Asthma Day we want to hear from your child! We are running a short 45 minute question and answer session with Professor Ian Sinha where your child will be able to ask their own questions about managing their asthma. The session will run from 5.30pm-6.15pm. If your child would like to take part please email Anna at ___LINK_REMOVED___.
We have a face to face support group for parents and carers of children with asthma running in Bromley. If you would like to attend please reach out to Louise, our wonderful parent volunteer for a cuppa, chat and support in a group who understands. For more details email Louise at ___LINK_REMOVED___ or call 0300 222 5800.
